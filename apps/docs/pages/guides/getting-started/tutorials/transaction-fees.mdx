### Introduction

In order to prevent the network being spammed, transactions on Dijets require the payment of a
a minimal transaction fee. The fee is paid in DJTX. There are no miners in Dijets so the ransaction fee is instead burned
(destroyed forever by sending the amount to a blackhole address). This burning of the transaction fees avoids the common pitfalls of Gas Wars & front running
essentially turning Dijets into a deflationary cryptocurrency.

When you issue a transaction through Dijets's API, the transaction fee is
automatically deducted from one of the addresses you control.

## Ternary Chains Fee Schedule

Different types of transactions require payment of a different transaction fee.
This table shows the transaction fee schedule:

| Blockchain          | Transaction Type          | Fees        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Method Chain        | Create a Subnetwork       | 1 DJTX      |
| Method Chain        | Create a Blockchain       | 1 DJTX      |
| Method Chain        | Add a Validator           | 0 DJTX      |
| Method Chain        | Add a Delegator           | 0 DJTX      |
| Method Chain        | Importing DJTX            | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Method Chain        | Exporting DJTX            | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Value Chain         | Transfer/Send             | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Value Chain         | Create a Smart Asset      | 0.01 DJTX   |
| Value Chain         | Mint an Asset             | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Value Chain         | Importing DJTX            | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Value Chain         | Exporting DJTX            | 0.001 DJTX  |
| Utility Chain       | Transfer/Send             | >= 0.001485*|

*Dijets Utility Chain is an EVM instance with variable gas fees. See below for more details.

### Dijets Utility Chain Fees

Dijets Utility Chain uses an algorithm to determine the "base fee" for a
transaction. The base fee increases when network utilisation levels are above the threshold
and decreases when network utilisation levels are below the threshold.

### Dynamic Fee Transactions

Transaction fees for non-atomic transactions are based on [Ethereum's EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)
style Dynamic Fee Transactions, which consists of a **gasFeeCap** and **gasTipCap**

The fee cap specifies the maximum price the transaction is willing to pay per
unit of gas. The tip cap specifies the maximum
amount above the base fee that the transaction is willing to pay per unit of
gas. Therefore, the effective gas price paid by a transaction will be
`min(gasFeeCap, baseFee + gasTipCap)`. 

<Admonition type="info">
The Gas Tip Cap is also known as the Priority Fee.
</Admonition>

Unlike in Ethereum, where the priority
fee is paid to the miner that produces the block (resulting in Gas wars and front running), in Dijets both the base fees
and the priority fees are burned forever. For legacy transactions, which only specify a
single gas price, the gas price serves as both the gas fee cap and the gas tip
cap.

Users can make a simple API call to [`eth_baseFee`]()
method to estimate the base fee for upcoming block before submitting a transaction. 

<Admonition type="caution">
During or before constructing or executing your transaction, if more blocks are produced
then the base fee could be different from the base fee estimated by the API
call. It is thus important to treat this value just as an estimate.
</Admonition>

Use the
[eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas]()
API call to estimate the priority fee needed to be included in the next block. This API
call looks at the most recent blocks to determine what tips have been paid by
recent transactions for them to be included in the block.

Transactions are ordered by the priority fee, then the timestamp (oldest first).

Based off of this information, you can specify the **gasFeeCap** and **gasTipCap**
to your liking based on how you prioritize getting your transaction included as
quickly as possible vs. minimizing the price paid per unit of gas.

#### Base Fee

The base fee can go as low as 25 nDJTX (Gwei) and has no upper bound. You can
use the [`eth_baseFee`]() and
[eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas]()
API methods, or Dijets Utility Chain explorer for [Gas
Tracker](https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com), to estimate the gas price to use in
your transactions.

## Atomic Transaction Fees

#### What is an Atomic Transaction

An Atomic Transaction in Dijets is a type of transaction used to move funds between Dijets Ternary Chain Ledgers. There are two primary types
of Atomic Transactions - ImportTx and ExportTx.

Utility Chain's atomic transactions (that is imports and exports from/to other chains)
charge dynamic fees based on the amount of gas used by the transaction and the
base fee of the block that includes the atomic transaction.

Gas Used:

| Utility Chain Item  | Gas          |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Unsigned Tx Byte    | 1            |
| Signature           | 1000         |
| Per Atomic Tx       | 10000        |

We can derive from the above table that the gas used by an atomic transaction in Dijets is `1 * len(unsignedTxBytes) +
1,000 * numSignatures + 10,000`

The TX fee additionally takes the base fee into account. Due to the fact that
atomic transactions use units denominated in 9 decimal places, the base fee must
be converted to 9 decimal places before calculating the actual fee paid by the
transaction. Therefore, the actual fee is: `gasUsed * baseFee (converted to 9
decimals)`.
