## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Dijets node on [Amazon Web
Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). Cloud services like AWS are a good way
to ensure that your node is highly secure, available, and accessible.

To get started, you'll need:

- An AWS account
- A terminal with which to SSH into your AWS machine
- A place to securely store and back up files

This tutorial assumes your local machine has a Unix style terminal. If you're on
Windows, you'll have to adapt some of the commands used here.

## Log Into AWS

Signing up for AWS is outside the scope of this article, but Amazon has instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account).

It is highly recommended that you set up Multi-Factor Authentication on your
AWS root user account to protect it. Amazon has documentation for this
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root).

Once your account is set up, you should create a new EC2 instance. An EC2 is a
virtual machine instance in AWS's cloud. Go to the [AWS Management
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and enter the EC2 dashboard.

To log into the EC2 instance, you will need a key on your local machine that
grants access to the instance. First, create that key so that it can be assigned
to the EC2 instance later on. On the bar on the left side, under **Network &
Security**, select **Key Pairs.**

Select **Create key pair** to launch the key pair creation wizard.

Name your key `dijets`. If your local machine has MacOS or Linux, select the
`pem` file format. If it's Windows, use the `ppk` file format. Optionally, you
can add tags for the key pair to assist with tracking.


Click `Create key pair`. You should see a success message, and the key file
should be downloaded to your local machine. Without this file, you will not be
able to access your EC2 instance. **Make a copy of this file and put it on a
separate storage medium such as an external hard drive. Keep this file secret;
do not share it with others.**

## Create a Security Group

An AWS Security Group defines what internet traffic can enter and leave your EC2
instance. Think of it like a firewall. Create a new Security Group by selecting
**Security Groups** under the **Network & Security** drop-down.

This opens the Security Groups panel. Click **Create security group** in the top
right of the Security Groups panel.

You'll need to specify what inbound traffic is allowed. Allow SSH traffic from
your IP address so that you can log into your EC2 instance. (Each time your ISP
changes your IP address, you will need to modify this rule. If your ISP changes
regularly, you may allow SSH traffic from anywhere to avoid having to modify
this rule frequently.) Allow TCP traffic on port 9651 so your node can
communicate with other nodes on the network. Allow TCP traffic on port 9650 from
your IP so you can make API calls to your node. **It's important that you only
allow traffic on this port from your IP.** If you allow incoming traffic from
anywhere, this could be used as an denial of service attack vector. Finally,
allow all outbound traffic.

Add a tag to the new security group with key `Name` and value`Dijets Security
Group`. This will enable us to know what this security group is when we see it
in the list of security groups.


Click `Create security group`. You should see the new security group in the list of security groups.

## Launch an EC2 Instance

Now you're ready to launch an EC2 instance. Go to the EC2 Dashboard and select **Launch instance**.


Select **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type** for the operating system.


Next, choose your instance type. This defines the hardware specifications of the
cloud instance. In this tutorial we set up a **c5.2xlarge**. This should be more
than powerful enough since Dijets is a lightweight consensus protocol. To
create a c5.2xlarge instance, select the **Compute-optimized** option from the
filter drop-down menu.


Select the checkbox next to the c5.2xlarge instance in the table.

Click the **Next: Configure Instance Details** button in the bottom right-hand corner.


The instance details can stay as their defaults.

### Add Storage, Tags, Security Group

Click the **Next: Add Storage** button in the bottom right corner of the screen.

You need to add space to your instance's disk. You should start with at least
700GB of disk space. Although upgrades to reduce disk usage are always in
development, on average the database will continually grow, so you need to
constantly monitor disk usage on the node and increase disk space if needed.

Note that the image below shows 100GB as disk size, which was appropriate at the
time the screenshot was taken. You should check the current [recommended disk
space size](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego#installation) before
entering the actual value here.

Click **Next: Add Tags** in the bottom right corner of the screen to add tags to
the instance. Tags enable us to associate metadata with our instance. Add a tag
with key `Name` and value `My Dijets Node`. This will make it clear what this
instance is on your list of EC2 instances.

Now assign the security group created earlier to the instance. Choose **Select
an existing security group** and choose the security group created earlier.

Finally, click **Review and Launch** in the bottom right. A review page will
show the details of the instance you're about to launch. Review those, and if
all looks good, click the blue **Launch** button in the bottom right corner of
the screen.

You'll be asked to select a key pair for this instance. Select **Choose an
existing key pair** and then select the `dijets` key pair you made earlier in
the tutorial. Check the box acknowledging that you have access to the `.pem` or
`.ppk` file created earlier (make sure you've backed it up!) and then click
Launch Instances.

You should see a new pop up that confirms the instance is launching!

### Assign an Elastic IP

By default, your instance will not have a fixed IP. Let's give it a fixed IP
through AWS's Elastic IP service. Go back to the EC2 dashboard. Under **Network
& Security,** select **Elastic IPs**.

Select **Allocate Elastic IP address**.

Select the region your instance is running in, and choose to use Amazon’s pool
of IPv4 addresses. Click **Allocate**.

Select the Elastic IP you just created from the Elastic IP manager. From the
**Actions** drop-down, choose **Associate Elastic IP address**.

Select the instance you just created. This will associate the new Elastic IP
with the instance and give it a public IP address that won't change.

## Set Up DijetsNodeGo

Go back to the EC2 Dashboard and select `Running Instances`.

Select the newly created EC2 instance. This opens a details panel with information about the instance.

Copy the `IPv4 Public IP` field to use later. From now on we call this value `PUBLICIP`.

**Remember: the terminal commands below assume you're running Linux. Commands
may differ for MacOS or other operating systems. When copy-pasting a command
from a code block, copy and paste the entirety of the text in the block.**

Log into the AWS instance from your local machine. Open a terminal (try shortcut
`CTRL + ALT + T`) and navigate to the directory containing the `.pem` file you
downloaded earlier.

Move the `.pem` file to `$HOME/.ssh` (where `.pem` files generally live) with:

```bash
mv dijets.pem ~/.ssh
```

Add it to the SSH agent so that we can use it to SSH into your EC2 instance, and mark it as read-only.

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/dijets.pem; chmod 400 ~/.ssh/dijets.pem
```

SSH into the instance. (Remember to replace `PUBLICIP` with the public IP field from earlier.)

```text
ssh ubuntu@PUBLICIP
```

If the permissions are **not** set correctly, you will see the following error.

You are now logged into the EC2 instance.

If you have not already done so, update the instance to make sure it has the
latest operating system and security updates:

```text
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo reboot
```

This also reboots the instance. Wait 5 minutes, then log in again by running
this command on your local machine:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@PUBLICIP
```

You're logged into the EC2 instance again. Now we’ll need to set up our
Dijets node. Follow the [Set Up Dijets Node With
Installer](run-dijets-node-with-installer-script) tutorial or [Run Dijets Node manually](run-dijets-node-manually) 
to run a Dijets Node instance. If using the installer script you will need the `PUBLICIP` we set up earlier.

Your DijetsNodeGo node should now be running and in the process of bootstrapping. 
To check if it's done bootstrapping, you can issue an API call
using `curl`. If you're making the request from the EC2 instance, the request
is:

```text
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"X"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

Once the node is finished bootstrapping, the response will be:

```text
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "isBootstrapped": true
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

You can continue on, even if DijetsNodeGo isn't done bootstrapping.

In order to make your node a validator, you'll need its node ID. To get it, run:

```text
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

The response contains the node ID.

```text
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"nodeID":"NodeID-DznHmm3o7RkmpLkWMn9NqafH66mqunXbM"},"id":1}
```

In the above example the node ID is`NodeID-DznHmm3o7RkmpLkWMn9NqafH66mqunXbM`.
Copy your node ID for later. Your node ID is not a secret, so you can just paste
it into a text editor.

DijetsNodeGo has other APIs, such as the [Health
API](/docs/guides/node-apis/health-api), that may be used to interact with
the node. Some APIs are disabled by default. To enable such APIs, modify the
ExecStart section of `/etc/systemd/system/dijetsnodego.service` (created during
the installation process) to include flags that enable these endpoints. Don't
manually enable any APIs unless you have a reason to.

Back up the node's staking key and certificate in case the EC2 instance is
corrupted or otherwise unavailable. The node's ID is derived from its staking
key and certificate. If you lose your staking key or certificate then your node
will get a new node ID, which could cause you to become ineligible for a staking
reward if your node is a validator. **It is very strongly advised that you copy
your node's staking key and certificate**. The first time you run a node, it
will generate a new staking key/certificate pair and store them in directory
`/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking`.

Exit out of the SSH instance by running:

```bash
exit
```

Now you're no longer connected to the EC2 instance; you're back on your local machine.

To copy the staking key and certificate to your machine, run the following
command. As always, replace `PUBLICIP`.

```text
scp -r ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking ~/aws_dijets_backup
```

Now your staking key and certificate are in directory `~/aws_dijets_backup` .
**The contents of this directory are secret.** You should hold this directory on
storage not connected to the internet (like an external hard drive.)

## Increase Volume Size

If you need to increase the volume size, follow these instructions from AWS:

- [Request modifications to your EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html)
- [Extend a Linux file system after resizing a volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html)

We
recommend setting up AWS billing alerts so you can keep track of your billing and costs.
