### Optional Prerequisites:

1. You have completed the tutorial for "How to run a Dijets Node"

1. You have completed the tutorial for ["Funding a Test Account"](./funding-test-accounts)

1. You have some balance of Test DJTX on any of the Value, Utility or Method Chain.

1. You have Go language installed on your system with $GOBIN set to be [in your path.](#setting-bin-in-your-path)


## Introduction

Please note that this article shows how to transfer DJTX programmatically between any two
chains on Dijets.

## Getting Started

To use DijetsJS, you can clone the repo:

```text
git clone https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs.git
```

or add it to an existing project:

```text
yarn add --dev dijetsJs
```

For this tutorial we will use `ts-node` to run the example scripts directly from the dijetsJS directory.

In order to send DJTX, you need to have some DJTX. You can use a pre-funded
account on local network or get testnet DJTX from the [Dijets
Faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io), which is an easy way to get to play around
with Dijets. After getting comfortable with your code, you can run the code
on Mainnet once you have made the necessary/required changes.

## Transferring DJTX Using DijetsJS

The easiest way to transfer DJTX between chains is to use
[DijetsJs](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs) which is a programmatic
way to access and move DJTX.

DijetsJs allows you to create and sign transactions locally which is why it
is the recommended way to transfer DJTX between chains. We are moving away from
using Dijets Node's keystore because it requires you to keep your keys on a full
node which makes them a target for malicious hackers and a security concern.

### Example Code

Following files can be found under the
[examples](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/DijetsJs/tree/master/examples)
directory of DijetsJs project.

### Transaction Fees

Transaction fees are fixed on Value Chain and Method Chain, while dynamic yet (extremely economical) on Utility Chain. When transferring
tokens on Utility Chain, please take fee into consideration in calculating total amount to be
transferred.

## Testnet Workflow

This tutorial uses [Value Chain to Utility Chain](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/avm/buildExportTx-cchain-djtx.ts)
transfers as an example. Transferring between other chains are very similar processes.

### Transfer from the Value Chain to the Utility Chain

To transfer a specified amount of tokens from Value Chain to Utility Chain, the token needs to
be first exported from the Value Chain to the atomic memory, from where it is then
imported into the Utility Chain.

#### Export DJTX From Value Chain to Utility Chain

Select the
[**`examples/avm`**](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/tree/master/examples/avm)
folder to view the DijetsJS Value Chain examples. To export DJTX from the Value Chain
to the Utility Chain, select
[`avm/buildExportTx-cchain-djtx.ts`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/avm/buildExportTx-cchain-djtx.ts).

##### Private Key

Locate this line in the file

```js
const privKey: string = `${PrivateKeyPrefix}${DefaultLocalGenesisPrivateKey}`
```

and replace this with a private key that you control.

```js
const privKey: string = "<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE>"
```

##### Network Setting

The following settings work when using a local node started with [`--network-id=testnet`](../nodes/maintain/dijetsnodego-config-flags.md#network-id):

```js
const ip: string = "localhost"
const port: number = 9650
const protocol: string = "http"
const networkID: number = 5
```

However, to connect directly to the [Dijets Testnet API
server](../apis/dijetsnodego/public-api-server.md), the following changes are
needed:

```js
const ip: string = "testnet.dijets.io"
const port: number = 443
const protocol: string = "https"
const networkID: number = 5
```

Depending on the networkID passed in when instantiating Dijets, the encoded
addresses used will have a distinctive Human Readable Part(HRP) per each
network.

_Example Address: 5 - X-`test`19rknw8l0grnfunjrzwxlxync6zrlu33yxqzg0h_

For Dijets Testnet, 4 is the correct value to use.

```js
const networkID: number = 4
```

**Set the Correct Amount To Send:**

By default the scripts send the wallet's entire DJTX balance:

```js
const balance: BN = new BN(getBalanceResponse.balance)
const amount: BN = balance.sub(fee)
```

To send a different amount, please replace the code above with the following.
Below sets a new value of 0.01 DJTX (`10000000` Gwei). Value is set in Gwei
format where `1,000,000,000` Gwei = 1 DJTX

```js
const value: BN = new BN("10000000")
const amount: BN = value.sub(fee)
```

Run the export script:

```sh
ts-node examples/avm/buildExportTx-cchain-djtx.ts
```

This returns:

```sh
Success! TXID: 2uQvMcPZjmPXAyvz9cdKBphDDSmnxxx3vsUrxqpj3U92hsfQcc
```

#### Verify the Transaction

You can now pass this txID `2uQvMcPZjmPXAyvz9cdKBphDDSmnxxx3vsUrxqpj3U92hsfQcc`
into
[examples/avm/getTx.ts](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/avm/getTx.ts),
plus other similar network settings, then you can run

```zsh
ts-node examples/avm/getTx.ts
```

which returns:

```js
{
  unsignedTx: {
    networkID: 5,
    blockchainID: '2JVSBoinj9C2J33VntvzYtVJNZdN2NKiwwKjcumHUWEb5DbBrm',
    outputs: [ [Object] ],
    inputs: [ [Object], [Object] ],
    memo: '0x41564d207574696c697479206d6574686f64206275696c644578706f7274547820746f206578706f7274204156415820746f2074686520432d436861696e2066726f6d2074686520582d436861696e',
    destinationChain: 'yH8D7ThNJkxmtkuv2jgBa4P1Rn3Qpr4pPr7QYNfcdoS6k6HWp',
    exportedOutputs: [ [Object] ]
  },
  credentials: [
    {
      fxID: 'spdxUxVJQbX85MGxMHbKw1sHxMnSqJ3QBzDyDYEP3h6TLuxqQ',
      credential: [Object]
    },
    {
      fxID: 'spdxUxVJQbX85MGxMHbKw1sHxMnSqJ3QBzDyDYEP3h6TLuxqQ',
      credential: [Object]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Import the DJTX Token From Value Chain to Utility Chain

Select the
[**`examples/evm`**](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/tree/master/examples/evm)
folder to view the DijetsJS Utility Chain examples. To import DJTX to the Utility Chain
from the Value Chain, select
[`evm/buildImportTx-xchain.ts`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/evm/buildImportTx-xchain.ts)

Copy the [network setting from above](#network-setting) into `evm/buildImportTx-xchain.ts`.

Navigate to this part of the code and ensure that the `cHexAddress`(_Your
Utility Chain wallet address_) and `private key` are correct:

```ts
const cHexAddress: string = "<YOUR-CCHAIN-WALLET-ADDRESS-HERE>"
const privKey: string = "<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE>"
```

Run the import script:

```sh
ts-node examples/evm/buildImportTx-xchain.ts
```

This returns:

```sh
Success! TXID: 2uQvMcPZjmPXAyvz9cdKBphDDSmnxxx3vsUrxqpj3U92hsfQcc
```

A "Success" message with a Transaction ID signifies the completion of a transfer! You've transferred DJTX from the Value Chain to Utility Chain!

### Transfer from the Utility Chain to the Value Chain

To return the DJTX back to the Value Chain, you need to do the transfer in the opposite direction.

#### Export the DJTX Token From Utility Chain to Value Chain

Select the
[**`examples/evm`**](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/tree/master/examples/evm)
folder to view the DijetsJS Utility Chain examples. To export DJTX from the Value Chain
to the Utility Chain, select
[`evm/buildExportTx-xchain-djtx.ts`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/evm/buildExportTx-xchain-djtx.ts).

Make necessary changes as above for private key and network settings.

You can change the amount of DJTX to send by editing the _BN_ variable:
`djtxAmount`. The sample code assigns this as `1e7` or `10000000` (0.01 DJTX)

The fee here will only be for exporting the asset. The import fees will be
deducted from the UTXOs present on the Exported Atomic Memory, a memory location
where UTXOs stay after getting exported but before being imported.

```ts
let djtxAmount: BN = new BN(1e7)
let fee: BN = baseFee.div(new BN(1e9))
fee = fee.add(new BN(1e6))
```

Run the export script:

```zsh
dijetsjs $ ts-node examples/evm/buildExportTx-xchain-djtx.ts
Success! TXID: UAez3DTv26qmhKKFDvmQTayaXTPAVahHenDKe6xnUMhJbKuxc
```

#### Import the DJTX Token From Utility Chain to Value Chain

Before we run the [example import
script](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsJs/blob/master/examples/avm/buildImportTx-cchain.ts),
we need to make some changes to the code:

1. Change the [Network Setting](#network-setting) to meet Dijets Testnet network requirements.
2. Import your Private Key by following the steps listed [here](#private-key).
3. Run the Script!

```zsh
dijetsjs $ ts-node examples/avm/buildImportTx-cchain.ts
Success! TXID: Sm6Ec2GyguWyG3Li1pARmTpaZ6qLEPuVAHV8QBGL9JWwWAEgM
```

## Mainnet Workflow

Dijets Testnet workflow above can be adapted to Mainnet with the following modifications:

- The correct private key.
- Network setting should be to a Mainnet node, either [a local node on
  Mainnet](../nodes/maintain/dijetsnodego-config-flags.md#network-id) or
  [Dijets Mainnet API
  server](../apis/dijetsnodego/public-api-server.md#using-the-public-api-nodes)
  where `dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com` should be used for the `ip`.
- `const networkID: number = 1` based on [this](../apis/dijetsjs/manage-value-chain-keys.md#encode-bech32-addresses).
- Set the correct amount to send.
- The correct receiving address.

## Local Workflow

### Start the Local Network

Follow [Create a Local Test
Network](../quickstart/create-a-local-test-network.md#dijets-up)
to start a 5-node local network. Make sure that you get one of the port number
by following
[this](../quickstart/create-a-local-test-network.md#retrieve-all-nodes). In this
tutorial, we will assume one of the ports is 30301.

### Locate the Example Code and Make Necessary Changes

Most of the code are already set to run it on a local network. Do check the
following values to make sure they are correct.

```js
const ip: string = "localhost"
const port: number = 30301 // Change this to the correct value
const protocol: string = "http"
const networkID: number = 1337
```

Then run the export and import scripts to transfer tokens across chains.
