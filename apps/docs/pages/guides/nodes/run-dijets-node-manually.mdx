The quickest way to learn about Dijets is to run a node and interact with the network.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Install and run a Dijets node
- Connect to Dijets Network

This tutorial is primarily geared toward developers and people interested in how
the Dijets Platform works. If you're just interested in setting up a node for
staking, you may use the DijetsNodeGo installer script.  Installer automates
the installation process and sets it up as a system service, which is
recommended for unattended operation. You may also try things out by following
this tutorial first, and then later set up the node using the installer as a
permanent solution.

## Requirements

### Computer Hardware and OS

Dijets is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity
hardware. Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may
change.

1. RAM: 16 GiB
1. Storage: 250-500 GiB
1. CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
1. Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS &gt;= 12

### Networking

To run successfully, a Dijets Node needs to accept connections from the Internet
on the network port `9651`. Before you proceed with the installation, you need
to determine the networking environment your node will run in.

#### Running on a Cloud Provider

If your node is running on a cloud provider computer instance, it will have a
static IP. Find out what that static IP is, or set it up if you didn't already.

#### Running on a Home Connection

If you're running a node on a computer that is on a residential internet
connection, you have a dynamic IP; that is, your IP will change periodically.
You will need to set up inbound port forwarding of port `9651` from the internet
to the computer the node is installed on.

<Admonition type="warning">

Please note that a fully connected Dijets node maintains and communicates
over a couple of thousand of live TCP connections. For some low-powered and
older home routers that might be too much to handle. If that is the case you may
experience lagging on other computers connected to the same router, node getting
benched, failing to sync and similar issues.

## Running a Dijets Node

Let’s install DijetsNodeGo, the Golang implementation of a Dijets node, and
connect to the Dijets primary network.

### Download DijetsNodeGo

The node is a binary program. You can either download the source code and then
build the binary program, or you can download the pre-built binary. You don’t
need to do both.

Building the node from source is recommended if you're a developer looking to
experiment and build on Dijets.

#### **Source Code**

First install Go 1.18.1 or later. Follow the instructions
[here](https://golang.org/doc/install). You can verify by running `go version`.

Set `$GOPATH` environment variable properly for Go to look for Go Workspaces.
Please read [this](./create-local-network#setting-bin-in-your-path) for details. You can verify
by running `echo $GOPATH`.

Download the DijetsNodeGo repository into your `$GOPATH`:

```text
cd $GOPATH
```
```text
mkdir -p src/github.com/Dijets-Inc
```
```text
cd src/github.com/Dijets-Inc
```
```text
git clone git@github.com:Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego.git
```
```text
cd dijetsnodego
```

<Admonition type="info">
This checkouts to the master branch. For the latest stable version, checkout the latest tag.
</Admonition>
Build DijetsNodeGo:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

The binary, named `dijetsnodego`, is in `dijetsnodego/build`. If you've followed
the instructions so far, this will be within your `$GOPATH` at:
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/build`.

To begin running DijetsNodeGo, run the following (hit Ctrl+C to stop your node):

```bash
./build/dijetsnodego
```

### Start a Node, and Connect to Dijets Mainnet

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="text"
>
  <TabPanel id="text" label="Source Builds">
  If you built Dijets node binary from source, run:
  ```bash
  ./build/dijetsnodego
  ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel id="before" label="Pre-built Mac OS Binaries">
  If you downloaded pre-built Dijets node binary for MacOS, run:
  ```bash
  ./dijetsnodego-<VERSION>/build/dijetsnodego
  ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel id="after" label="Pre-built Linux Binaries">
  If you downloaded pre-built Dijets node binary for Linux, run:
  ```bash
  ./dijetsnodego-<VERSION>-linux/dijetsnodego
  ```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
By default this node will connect to Dijets Mainnet.

When the node starts, it has to catch up with the rest of the
network in a process called bootstrapping. Your node will have successfully finished bootstrapping
when it prints logs as follows:

```text
[01-02|10:20:15.195] INFO <Utility Chain> cacid/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2ksGoFVpnDCbFKX4jRpJwH8EFws33Q2yC1HhWgAiy3tGrpDSxc"}
[01-02|10:20:16.102] INFO <Method Chain> cacid/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2nhvXBcLAzeloCPEMv6aHGvZ30oa1SBp1reEm7gNxvFjnfKADV"}
[01-02|10:20:21.303] INFO <Value Chain> dijets/transitive.go:334 consensus starting {"lenFrontier": 1}
```

Run the following command in a separate terminal to check if a given chain has finished the bootstrapping process:

```text
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"Value"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

If this returns `true`, the chain is bootstrapped; otherwise, it returns
`false`. If you make other API calls to a chain that is not done bootstrapping,
it will return `API call rejected because chain is not done bootstrapping`. If
you are still experiencing issues please contact us on
[Qowalts](https://redirect.dijets.io/#/#dijets-support:dijets.org)

Your node is running and connected now. If you want to use your node as a
validator on the mainnet and earn rewards for helping secure the network.

You can use `Ctrl + C` to kill the node.

To be able to make API calls to your node from other machines, when starting up
the node include argument `--http-host=` (for example `./build/dijetsnodego
--http-host=`)

#### Connect to Dijets Testnet

To connect to the Dijets Testnet instead of the Mainnet, use argument
`--network-id=dijets-testnet`. You can get funds on Dijets Testnet from
[Dijets Faucet.](https://faucet.dijets.io/)

## What Next?

A fully bootstrapped Node on Dijets network is capable of performing consensus on its own.
However, the rest of the network will not query your node for sampling purposes when trying to reach consensus.
Only the validator nodes are queried for sampling during consensus.

Now that you have successfully launched your Node, you can learn how to add it as a Validator on Dijets Network.
Check out [Add a Validator](validator-nodes) for a step-by-step guide on how to become a Validator.
