# Run a Dijets Node Using the Install Script

The installer script is a shell (bash) script that installs DijetsNodeGo on your computer. This
script sets up full, running node in a matter of minutes with minimal user input
required.

This installer script assumes that:

- DijetsNodeGo is not running and not already installed as a service
- User running the script has superuser privileges (can run `sudo`)

### Environment Considerations

This script has primarily been developed for and tested for Ubuntu 20.04 upwards.
If you run a different flavor of Linux than the script might not work as intended.
It assumes `systemd` is used to run system services. Other Linux flavors might
use something else, or might have files in different places than is assumed by
the script. 

#### Node Running from Terminal

If you already have a Dijets node running in a terminal stop it by pressing `ctrl+C`.

#### Node Running as a Service

If your node is already running as a service, then you probably don't need this
script. You're already good to go.

#### Node Running in the Background

If your node is running in the background (by running with `nohup`, for example)
then find the process running the node by running `ps aux | grep dijets`.
This will produce output like:

```text
ubuntu  2409  0.0  0.0   2828   676 pts/1    S+   19:54   0:00 grep dijets
ubuntu  1189 26.1  9.4 2459236 753316 ?      Sl   Dec02 1220:52 /home/ubuntu/build/dijetsnodego
```

Look for line that doesn't have `grep` on it. In this example, that is the
second line. It shows information about your node. Note the process id, in this
case, `1189`. Stop the node by running `kill -2 1189`.

#### Node Working Files

If you previously ran a DijetsNodeGo node on this computer, you will have local
node files stored in `$HOME/.dijetsnodego` directory. Those files will not be
disturbed, and node set up by the script will continue operation with the same
identity and state it had before. That being said, for your node's security,
back up any private keys for staking, found in
`$HOME/.dijetsnodego/staking` folder and store them somewhere secure. You can use those
files to recreate your node on a different computer if you ever need to. Check
out the tutorial on [Node Backup](node-backup-and-restore) for backup and
restore procedure.

### Networking Considerations

To run successfully, DijetsNodeGo needs to accept connections from the Internet
on the network port `9651`. Before you proceed with the installation, you need
to determine the networking environment your node will run in.

#### Running on a Cloud Provider

If your node is running on a cloud provider computer instance, it will have a
static IP. Find out what that static IP is, or set it up if you haven't done so already.
The script will try to find out the IP by itself, but that might not work in all
environments, so you will need to check the IP or enter it yourself.

#### Running on a Home Connection

If you're running a node on a computer that is on a residential internet
connection, then you more than likely have a dynamic IP; that is, your IP will change periodically.
The install script will configure the node appropriately for that situation.
But, for a home connection, you will need to set up inbound port forwarding of
port `9651` from the internet to the computer the node is installed on.

Alternatively you can ask your ISP to provide you with a static IP.

<Admonition type="caution">

Please note that a fully connected Dijets node maintains and communicates
over a couple of thousand of live TCP connections. For some low-powered and
older home routers that might be too much to handle. If that is the case you may
experience lagging on other computers connected to the same router, node getting
benched, failing to sync and similar issues.

</Admonition>

## Running the Script

To download and run the script, enter the following in the terminal:

```bash
wget -nd -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-terraform-construct/master/installer/dijets-installer.sh;\
chmod 755 dijets-installer.sh;\
./dijets-installer.sh
```

The above commands start the Node installation process. The output should look something like this:

```text

```

And then the script will prompt you for information about the network environment:

```text
To complete the setup some networking information is needed.
Where is the node installed:
1) residential network (dynamic IP)
2) cloud provider (static IP)
Enter your connection type [1,2]:
```

Enter `1` if you have a dynamic IP, and `2` if you have a static IP. 

<Admonition type="info">
  If you are on
a static IP, the installer script will try to auto-detect the IP and ask for confirmation.
</Admonition>

```text
Detected '2.16.168.14' as your public IP. Is this correct? [y,n]:
```

Confirm with `y`, or `n` if the detected IP is wrong (or empty), and then enter
the correct IP at the next prompt.

Next, you have to set up RPC port access for your node. Those are used to query
the node for its internal state, to send commands to the node, or to interact
with the platform and its chains (sending transactions, for example). You will
be prompted with:

```text
Do you want the RPC port to be accessible to any or only local network interface? [any, local]:
```

`local` This setting only allows RPC requests from the node machine itself.
`any` This setting allows you to send RPC requests to your node
from a remote machine. 

The script will then continue with system service creation and finish with starting the service:

```text
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/dijetsnodego.service → /etc/systemd/system/dijetsnodego.service.

Done!

Your node should now begin the bootstrapping process where it tries to catch up to the latest block in the chain.
Node configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/configs/node.json
Utility Chain configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/configs/chains/UC/config.json
To check that the service is running use the following command (q to exit):
sudo systemctl status dijetsnodego
To follow the log use (ctrl-c to stop):
sudo journalctl -u dijetsnodego -f

Reach us over on [Qowalts](https://redirect.dijets.io/#/#dijets-support:dijets.org/) if you're having problems.
```

## Post Installation

DijetsNodeGo should be running in the background as a service. You can check that it's running with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status dijetsnodego
```

This will print the node's latest logs, which should look like this:

```text
● dijetsnodego.service - DijetsNodeGo systemd service
Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/dijetsnodego.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2021-01-05 10:38:21 UTC; 51s ago
Main PID: 2142 (dijetsnodego)
Tasks: 8 (limit: 4495)
Memory: 223.0M
CGroup: /system.slice/dijetsnodego.service
└─2142 /home/ubuntu/dijets-node/dijetsnodego --dynamic-public-ip=opendns --http-host=
```

Note the `active (running)` which indicates the service is running OK. You may
need to press `q` to return to the command prompt.

To find out your NodeID, which is used to identify your node to the network, run the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dijetsnodego | grep "NodeID"
```

It will produce output like:

```text
Jan 05 10:38:38 ip-172-31-30-64 dijetsnodego[2142]: INFO [01-05|10:38:38] dijetsnodego/node/node.go#428: Set node's ID to 7S2JhkGp7yKPzwpfd7KNwcM217ZuMzPFT
```

Prepend `NodeID-` to the value you get, for example,
`NodeID-7S2JhkGp7yKPzwpfd7KNwcM217ZuMzPFT`. Store that; it will be needed for
staking or looking up your node.

## Stopping the Node

To stop DijetsNodeGo, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dijetsnodego
```

To start it again, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start dijetsnodego
```

## Advanced Node Configuration

Without any additional arguments, the script installs the node in a most common
configuration. But the script also enables various advanced options to be
configured, via the command line prompts. Following is a list of advanced
options and their usage:

- `admin` - [Admin API](/docs/node-apis/admin-api) will be enabled
- `archival` - disables database pruning and preserves the complete transaction history
- `state-sync` - if `on` state-sync for the Utility Chain is used, if `off` it will
  use regular transaction replay to bootstrap; state-sync is much faster, but
  has no historical data
- `db-dir` - used to provide the full path to the location where the database
  will be stored
- `testnet` - node will connect to Dijets testnet instead of the Mainnet
- `index` - [Index API](/docs/node-apis/index-api) will be
  enabled
- `ip` - use `dynamic`, `static` arguments, of enter a desired IP directly to be
  used as the public IP node will advertise to the network
- `rpc` - use `any` or `local` argument to select any or local network interface
  to be used to listen for RPC calls

Please note that configuring `index` and `archival` options on an existing node
will require a fresh bootstrap to recreate the database.

Complete script usage can be displayed by entering:

```bash
./dijets-installer.sh --help
```

### Unattended Installation

If you want to use the script in an automated environment where you cannot enter
the data at the prompts you must provide at least the `rpc` and `ip` options.
For example:

```bash
./dijetsnodego-installer.sh --ip 1.2.3.4 --rpc local
```

### Usage Examples

To run a Mainnet node with indexing enabled and autodetected static IP:

```bash
./dijetsnodego-installer.sh --mainnet --ip static --index
```

To run an archival Mainnet node with dynamic IP and database located at `/home/node/db`:

```bash
./dijetsnodego-installer.sh --archival --ip dynamic --db-dir /home/node/db
```

To use Utility Chain state-sync to quickly bootstrap a Mainnet node, with dynamic IP and local RPC only:

```bash
./dijetsnodego-installer.sh --state-sync on --ip dynamic --rpc local
```

## Node Configuration

File that configures node operation is `~/.dijetsnodego/configs/node.json`. You
can edit it to add or change configuration options. The documentation of
configuration options can be found
[here](node-flags-configs). Configuration may look like
this:

```json
{
  "dynamic-public-ip": "opendns",
  "http-host": ""
}
```

Note that configuration file needs to be a properly formatted `JSON` file, so
switches are formatted differently than for command line, so don't enter options
like `--dynamic-public-ip=opendns` but as in the example above.

Script also creates an empty Utility Chain config file, located at
`~/.dijetsnodego/configs/chains/UC/config.json`. By editing that file you can
configure the Utility Chain. Click
[here](chain-config-flags) to read about the chain configuration for Utility Chain.
