}

## Overview

The objective of this document is to provide and explain sending transactions
with dynamic fees using JavaScript. Make sure you have followed [the tutorial on
adjusting the dynamic fees using
MetaMask](dynamic-gas-fee#adjusting-gas-fees-before-submitting-the-transaction). There, we have
explained the key concepts related to dynamic fees and EIP1559 type of
transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- Basic familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- Basic familiarity with [Dijets and its Ternary Chains](../introduction)
- Basic understanding of [dynamic fee transactions](dynamic-gas-fee#keywords-and-concepts)

## Installing Dependencies

Open the terminal and install the following dependencies in a new folder.

- Ethers
- dijets
- dotenv

```text
npm install ethers dijets dotenv
```

## Setting up Environment and Project

To send a transaction we need to sign it using our private key. But private key
should not be hard coded in the code, rather must be fetched through some
environment variables. Make a `.env` file in the root folder with the following
content.

```env
PRIVATEKEY=<TYPE_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE>
```

Now make a new file named `app.js` in the root folder, which will be our main and only
file with the `sendDjtx()` function. Follow the rest of the tutorial by
understanding and pasting the provided snippets sequentially in the `app.js`
file.

## Importing Dependencies and Private Key

```js
const ethers = require("ethers")
const Dijets = require("dijets").Dijets
require("dotenv").config()

const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATEKEY
```

## Setting up HTTP Provider Connected with Dijets TestNet Network

Using the HTTP provider, we will connect to one of the nodes on the Dijets TestNet
network. Using this provider we will send the signed transaction to the network.
You can also connect to Mainnet using the URL -
`https://dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:443/ext/bc/C/rpc`

```javascript
// For sending a signed transaction to the network
const nodeURL = "https://dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:443/ext/bc/C/rpc"
const HTTPSProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(nodeURL)
```

## Setting up Utility Chain APIs for Estimating Base and Priority Fees

To estimate the max fee and max priority fee on the network, we will be using
Utility Chain APIs. We can use the Utility Chain through a DijetsJS instance connected
to the network as shown below.

```javascript
// For estimating max fee and priority fee using CChain APIs
const chainId = 98200
const dijets = new Dijets(
  "dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:443",
  undefined,
  "https",
  chainId
)
const uchain = dijets.UChain()
```

## Setting up Wallet

A wallet is required for signing transactions with your private key and thus making it valid.

```javascript
// For signing an unsigned transaction
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey)
const address = wallet.address
```

## Function for Estimating Max Fee and Max Priority Fee

The function `calcFeeData()` estimates the max fee and max priority fee per gas
according to network activity using the Utility Chain APIs. This function returns max
fee and max priority fee per gas in units of `nDJTX` or `gwei` (1 DJTX = 10^9
gwei).

```javascript
// Function to estimate max fee and max priority fee
const calcFeeData = async (
  maxFeePerGas = undefined,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas = undefined
) => {
  const baseFee = parseInt(await cchain.getBaseFee(), 16) / 1e9
  maxPriorityFeePerGas =
    maxPriorityFeePerGas == undefined
      ? parseInt(await cchain.getMaxPriorityFeePerGas(), 16) / 1e9
      : maxPriorityFeePerGas
  maxFeePerGas =
    maxFeePerGas == undefined ? baseFee + maxPriorityFeePerGas : maxFeePerGas

  if (maxFeePerGas < maxPriorityFeePerGas) {
    throw "Error: Max fee per gas cannot be less than the max priority fee per gas"
  }

  return {
    maxFeePerGas: maxFeePerGas.toString(),
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: maxPriorityFeePerGas.toString(),
  }
}
```

## Function to Create, Sign and Send Transaction

The function `sendDjtx()` takes 4 arguments -

- `amount` - Amount of DJTX to send in the transaction
- `address` - Destination address to which we want to send DJTX
- `maxFeePerGas` - Desired maximum fee per gas you want to pay in nDJTX
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas` - Desired maximum priority fee per gas you want to pay in nDJTX
- `nonce` - Used as a differentiator for more than 1 transaction with same signer

The last 3 arguments are optional, and if `undefined` is passed, then it will
use the `calcFeeData()` function to estimate them. Each transaction with the
same data and parameters is differentiated by a nonce value. If there are more
than 1 transactions with the same nonce signed by the same address, then only 1
of them with the highest effective priority fee will be accepted. 

Note that the `nonce`
parameter should only be used when you are either re-issuing or cancelling a
stuck transaction.

```javascript
// Function to send DJTX
const sendDjtx = async (
  amount,
  to,
  maxFeePerGas = undefined,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas = undefined,
  nonce = undefined
) => {
  if (nonce == undefined) {
    nonce = await HTTPSProvider.getTransactionCount(address)
  }

  // If the max fee or max priority fee is not provided, then it will automatically calculate using Utility Chain APIs
  ;({ maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas } = await calcFeeData(
    maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas
  ))

  maxFeePerGas = ethers.utils.parseUnits(maxFeePerGas, "gwei")
  maxPriorityFeePerGas = ethers.utils.parseUnits(maxPriorityFeePerGas, "gwei")

  // Type 2 transaction is for EIP1559
  const tx = {
    type: 2,
    nonce,
    to,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas,
    maxFeePerGas,
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther(amount),
    chainId,
  }

  tx.gasLimit = await HTTPSProvider.estimateGas(tx)

  const signedTx = await wallet.signTransaction(tx)
  const txHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(signedTx)

  console.log("Sending signed transaction")

  // Sending a signed transaction and waiting for its inclusion
  await (await HTTPSProvider.sendTransaction(signedTx)).wait()

  console.log(
    `View transaction with nonce ${nonce}: https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/tx/${txHash}`
  )
}
```

This function calculates transaction hash from the signed transaction and logs
on the console, the URL for transaction status on Dijets Utility Chain explorer.

## Calling the `sendDJTX()` Function

There are various ways to call this function. We may or may not pass the
optional arguments like max fee and max priority fee. It is recommended to set
the max fee as the maximum price per gas that you are willing to pay for a
transaction, no matter how high or low the base fee will be, as at max you will
only be charged the provided max fee, along with a small priority fee above the
base fee.

If you do not pass these arguments, then it will automatically estimate the max
fee and priority fee from the network. For example, let's say, Bob want to pay 100
nDJTX per gas for a transaction and a small tip of 2 nDJTX, then Bob will call
the following function.

```javascript
// setting max fee as 100 and priority fee as 2
sendDjtx("0.01", "0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC", 100, 2)
```

**This function should not be used without a max fee per gas. As you will have
to pay the estimated price, even if it is higher than your budget.**

### Different Scenarios

| Max Fee       | Priority Fee       | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **undefined** | 2                  | Calculates the max fee by adding the provided priority fee with the estimated base fee. Note that the max fee will now be capped by `baseFee + priorityFee`, which can consume all the provided priority fees. |
| 100           | **undefined**      | Estimates the priority fee and uses the provided max fee. If the estimated priority fee is more than the provided max fee, then it throws an error.                                                            |
| **undefined** | **undefined**      | It will estimate the base fee and priority fee from the network, and will add both the values to calculate the max fee per gas. Again, you have to pay whatever will be estimated.                             |

## Re-issuing a Stuck Transaction

Sometimes during high network activity, some transactions can get stuck as pending for a long time, 
due to relatively lower effective tip than the
other transactions in the pool. We can either re-issue the same transaction with
a higher priority fee or cancel the transaction altogether. To re-issue the stuck
transaction, you can send a new transactiob with same amount and data but with higher
priority fee and same nonce value as the stuck transaction. The transaction with
lower effective tip will automatically be rejected (due to same nonce). 

You can also cancel the stuck transaction, by sending a new transaction but
keeping the amount to 0, with a higher priority fee and same nonce. Let's say,
the above transaction with a nonce value of 25 has stuck. You can then re-issue
a new transaction with same nonce, but higher priority fee this time.

```javascript
// reissuing transaction with nonce 25
sendDjtx("0.01", "0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC", 100, 10, 25)

// cancelling transaction with nonce 25
sendDjtx("0", "0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC", 100, 10, 25)
```

## Conclusion

You have learned about creating, signing, and sending transactions with dynamic
fee parameters to the Utility Chain of Dijets network using JavaScript. It also
explained, how to re-issue or cancel a stuck transaction, by sending a
transaction with the same nonce. This tutorial points out the recommended way
for choosing max fee cap and max priority fee cap for transactions and can also
work as a general guide for all the EVM-based chains.
