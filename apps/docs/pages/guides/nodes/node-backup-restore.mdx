# Node Backup and Restore

It is always good practice and simply wise to make preparations for
disaster
recovery. Should your machine ever have a catastrophic failure due to either
hardware or software issues, or even a case of natural disaster, it's best to be
prepared for such a situation by making a backup of your DijetsNodeGo files.

When running, a complete node installation along with the database can grow to
be multiple gigabytes in size. Having to back up and restore such a large volume
of data can be expensive, complicated and time-consuming. Luckily, there is a
better way.

Instead of having to back up and restore everything, we need to back up only
what is essential, that is, those files that cannot be reconstructed because
they are unique to your node. For DijetsNodeGo node, unique files are those that
identify your node on the network, in other words, files that define your
NodeID.

Even if your node is a validator on the network and has multiple delegations on
it, you don't need to worry about backing up anything else, because the
validation and delegation transactions are also stored on the blockchain and
will be restored during bootstrapping, along with the rest of the blockchain
data.

The installation itself can be easily recreated by installing the node on a new
machine, and all the remaining gigabytes of blockchain data can be easily
recreated by the process of bootstrapping, which copies the data over from other
network peers. However, if you would like to speed up the process, see the
[Database Backup and Restore section](#database)

## NodeID

NodeID is a unique identifier that differentiates your node from all the other
peers on the network. It's a string formatted like
`NodeID-7S2JhkGp7yKPzwpfd7KNwcM217ZuMzPFT`. You can look up the specs section to see how the NodeID is constructed
[here](/docs/guides/cryptographic-primitives#tls-addresses).

In the default installation, they can be found in the working directory,
specifically in `~/.dijetsnodego/staking/`. All we need to do to recreate the
node on another machine is to run a new installation with those same two files.

### Backup

To back up your node, we need to store `staker.crt` and `staker.key` files
somewhere safe and private, preferably to a different computer, to your private
storage in the cloud, a USB stick or similar. Storing them to a couple of
different, secure locations increases the safety.

:::caution

If someone gets a hold of your staker files, they still cannot get to your
funds, as they are controlled by the wallet private keys, not by the node. But,
they could re-create your node somewhere else, and depending on the
circumstances make you lose the staking rewards. So make sure your staker files
are secure.

:::

Let's get the staker files off the machine running the node.

#### From Local Node

If you're running the node locally, on your desktop computer, just navigate to
where the files are and copy them somewhere safe.

On a default Linux installation, the path to them will be
`/home/USERNAME/.dijetsnodego/staking/`, where `USERNAME` needs to be replaced
with the actual username running the node. Select and copy the files from there
to a backup location. You don't need to stop the node to do that.

#### From Remote Node Using `scp`

`scp` is a 'secure copy' command line program, available built-in on Linux and
MacOS computers. There is also a Windows version, `pscp`, as part of the
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) package.
If using `pscp`, in the following commands replace each usage of `scp` with
`pscp -scp`.

To copy the files from the node, you will need to be able to remotely log into
the machine. You can use account password, but the secure and recommended way is
to use the SSH keys. The procedure for acquiring and setting up SSH keys is
highly dependent on your cloud provider and machine configuration. You can refer
to our [Amazon Web
Services](run-dijets-node-with-aws)
and [Microsoft Azure](run-dijets-node-with-azure)
setup guides for those providers. Other providers will have similar procedures.

When you have means of remote login into the machine, you can copy the files
over with the following command:

```text
scp -r ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking ~/dijets_backup
```

This assumes the username on the machine is `ubuntu`, replace with correct
username in both places if it is different. Also, replace `PUBLICIP` with the
actual public IP of the machine. If `scp` doesn't automatically use your
downloaded SSH key, you can point to it manually:

```text
scp -i /path/to/the/key.pem -r ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking ~/dijets_backup
```

Once executed, this command will create `dijets_backup` directory in you home
directory and place staker files in it. You need to store them somewhere safe.

### Restore

To restore your node from a backup, we need to do the reverse: restore
`staker.key` and `staker.crt` from the backup to the working directory of the
node.

First, we need to do the usual
[installation](/docs/guides/nodes/run-dijets-node-with-installer) of the node. This will
create a new NodeID, which we need to replace. When the node is installed
correctly, log into the machine where the node is running and stop it:

```text
sudo systemctl stop dijetsnodego
```

We're ready to restore the node.

#### To Local Node

If you're running the node locally, just copy the `staker.key` and `staker.crt`
files from the backup location into the working directory, which on the default
Linux installation will be `/home/USERNAME/.dijetsnodego/staking/`. Replace
`USERNAME` with the actual username used to run the node.

#### To Remote Node Using `scp`

Again, the process is just the reverse operation. Using `scp` we need to copy
the `staker.key` and `staker.crt` files from the backup location into the remote
working directory. Assuming the backed up files are located in the directory
where the above backup procedure placed them:

```text
scp ~/dijets_backup/staker.* ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking
```

Or if you need to specify the path to the SSH key:

```text
scp -i /path/to/the/key.pem ~/dijets_backup/staker.* ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/.dijetsnodego/staking
```

And again, replace `ubuntu` with correct username if different, and `PUBLICIP`
with the actual public IP of the machine running the node, as well as the path
to the SSH key if used.

#### Restart the Node and Verify

Once the files have been replaced, log into the machine and start the node using:

```text
sudo systemctl start dijetsnodego
```

You can now check that the node is restored with the correct NodeID by issuing
the [getNodeID](/docs/guides/node-apis/info-api#infogetnodeid) API call in
the same console you ran the previous command:

```text
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

You should see your original NodeID. Restore process is done.

## Database

Normally, when starting a new node, you can just bootstrap from scratch.
However, there are situations when you may prefer to reuse an existing database
(ex: preserve keystore records, reduce sync time).

This tutorial will walk you through compressing your node's
DB and moving it to another computer using `zip` and `scp`.

### Database Backup

First, make sure to stop DijetsNodeGo, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dijetsnodego
```

:::warning
You must stop the Dijets node before you back up the database otherwise data
could become corrupted.
:::

Once the node is stopped, you can `zip` the database directory to reduce the
size of the backup and speed up the transfer using `scp`:

```bash
zip -r dijets_db_backup.zip .dijetsnodego/db
```

_Note: It may take > 30 minutes to zip the node's DB._

Next, you can transfer the backup to another machine:

```bash
scp -r ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/dijets_db_backup.zip ~/dijets_db_backup.zip
```

This assumes the username on the machine is `ubuntu`, replace with correct
username in both places if it is different. Also, replace `PUBLICIP` with the
actual public IP of the machine. If `scp` doesn't automatically use your
downloaded SSH key, you can point to it manually:

```bash
scp -i /path/to/the/key.pem -r ubuntu@PUBLICIP:/home/ubuntu/dijets_db_backup.zip ~/dijets_db_backup.zip
```

Once executed, this command will create `dijets_db_backup.zip` directory in you home directory.

### Database Restore

_This tutorial assumes you have already completed "Database Backup" and have
a backup at ~/dijets_db_backup.zip._

First, we need to do the usual
[installation](/docs/guides/nodes/run-dijets-node-with-installer) of the node. When the
node is installed correctly, log into the machine where the node is running and
stop it:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dijetsnodego
```

:::warning
You must stop the Dijets node before you restore the database otherwise data
could become corrupted.
:::

We're ready to restore the database. First, let's move the DB on the existing
node (you can remove this old DB later if the restore was successful):

```bash
mv .dijetsnodego/db .dijetsnodego/db-old
```

Next, we'll unzip the backup we moved from another node (this will place the
unzipped files in `~/.dijetsnodego/db` when the command is run in the home directory):

```bash
unzip dijets_db_backup.zip
```

After the database has been restored on a new node, use this command to start the node:

```bash
sudo systemctl start dijetsnodego
```

Node should now be running from the database on the new instance. To check that
everything is in order and that node is not bootstrapping from scratch (which
would indicate a problem), use:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dijetsnodego -f
```

The node should be catching up to the network and fetching a small number of
blocks before resuming normal operation (all the ones produced from the time
when the node was stopped before the backup).

Once the backup has been restored and is working as expected, the zip can be deleted:

```bash
rm dijets_db_backup.zip
```

### Database Direct Copy

You may be in a situation where you don't have enough disk space to create the
archive containing the whole database, so you cannot complete the backup process
as described previously.

In that case, you can still migrate your database to a new computer, by using a
different approach: `direct copy`. Instead of creating the archive, moving the
archive and unpacking it, we can do all of that on the fly.

To do so, you will need `ssh` access from the destination machine (where you
want the database to end up) to the source machine (where the database currently
is). Setting up `ssh` is the same as explained for `scp` earlier in the
document.

Same as shown previously, you need to stop the node (on both machines):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dijetsnodego
```

<Admonition type="caution">
You must stop the Dijets node before you back up the database otherwise data
could become corrupted.
</Admonition>

Then, on the destination machine, change to a directory where you would like to
put the database files, enter the following command:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/the/key.pem ubuntu@PUBLICIP 'tar czf - .dijetsnodego/db' | tar xvzf - -C .
```

Make sure to replace the correct path to the key, and correct IP of the source
machine. This will compress the database, but instead of writing it to a file it
will pipe it over `ssh` directly to the destination machine, where it will be
decompressed and written to disk. The process can take a long time depending upon the size of the database so please make sure it
completes before continuing.

After copying is done, all you need to do now is move the database to the
correct location on the destination machine. Assuming there is a default
DijetsNodeGo node installation, we remove the old database and replace it with
the new one:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.dijetsnodego/db
mv db ~/.dijetsnodego/db
```

You can now start the node on the destination machine:

```bash
sudo systemctl start dijetsnodego
```

Node should now be running from the copied database. To check that everything is
in order and that node is not bootstrapping from scratch (which would indicate a
problem), use:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dijetsnodego -f
```

The node should be catching up to the network and fetching a small number of
blocks before resuming normal operation (all the ones produced from the time
when the node was stopped before the backup).
