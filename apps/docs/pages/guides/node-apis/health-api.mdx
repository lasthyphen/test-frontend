This API can be used for measuring a node health.

To get an HTTP status code response that indicates the node’s health, make a `GET` request to
`/ext/health`. If the node is healthy, it will return a `200` status code. If you want more in-depth
information about a node’s health, use the methods below.

<Admonition type="info">

This API set is for a specific node, it is unavailable on the [public
server](../public-api-server.md).

</Admonition>

## Format

This API uses the `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see
[here](issuing-api-calls).

## Endpoint

```text
/ext/health
```

## Methods

### `health.health`

The node runs a set of health checks every 30 seconds, including a health check for each chain. This
method returns the last set of health check results.

**Signature:**

```sh
health.health() -> {
    checks: []{
        checkName: {
            message: JSON,
            error: JSON,
            timestamp: string,
            duration: int,
            contiguousFailures: int,
            timeOfFirstFailure: int
        }
    },
    healthy: bool
}
```

`healthy` is true if the node if all health checks are passing.

`checks` is a list of health check responses.

- A check response may include a `message` with additional context.
- A check response may include an `error` describing why the check failed.
- `timestamp` is the timestamp of the last health check.
- `duration` is the execution duration of the last health check, in nanoseconds.
- `contiguousFailures` is the number of times in a row this check failed.
- `timeOfFirstFailure` is the time this check first failed.

More information on these measurements can be found in the documentation for the
[go-sundheit](https://github.com/AppsFlyer/go-sundheit) library.

Example Call:

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"health.health"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health
```

Example Response:

In this example response, the Utility Chain’s health check is failing.
