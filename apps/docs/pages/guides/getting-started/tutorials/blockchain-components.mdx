## Intro

The Dijets network consists of 3 built-in blockchains: Value Chain, Utility Chain, and
Method Chain. The Value Chain is used to manage assets and uses the Dijets consensus
protocol. The Utility Chain is used to create and interact with smart contracts. The Method Chain is used to coordinate
validators and stake and acts as the metadata chain for the network. A set of validators
makes up a Subnetwork. Subnetworks can validate 1 or more chains. It is a common
misconception that 1 Subnetwork = 1 chain and this is shown by the primary Subnetwork of
Dijets which is made up of the Value Chain, Utility Chain, and Method Chain.

A node in the Dijets network can either be a validator or a non-validator. A
validator stakes DJTX tokens and participates in consensus to earn rewards. A
non-validator does not participate in consensus or have any DJTX staked but can
be used as an API server. Both validators and non-validators need to have their
own copy of the chain and need to know the current state of the network.

Each blockchain on Dijets has several components: the virtual machine,
database, consensus engine, sender, and handler. These components help the chain
run smoothly. Blockchains also interact with the P2P layer and the chain router
to send and receive messages.

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

### Outbound Messages

[The OutboundMsgBuilder interface](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/message/outbound_msg_builder.go)
specifies methods that build messages of type `OutboundMessage`. Nodes
communicate to other nodes by sending `OutboundMessage` messages.

All messaging functions in `OutboundMsgBuilder` can be categorized as follows:

- **Handshake**
  - Nodes need to be on a certain version before they can be accepted into the network.
- **State Sync**
  - A new node can ask other nodes for the current state of the network. It only
    syncs the required state for a specific block.
- **Bootstrapping**
  - Nodes can ask other nodes for blocks to build their own copy of the chain. A
    node can fetch all blocks from the locally last accepted block to the
    current last accepted block in the network.
- **Consensus**
  - Once a node is up to tip they can participate in consensus! During
    consensus, a node conducts a poll to several different small random samples
    of the validator set. They can communicate decisions on whether or not they
    have accepted/rejected a block.
- **App**
  - VMs communicate application-specific messages to other nodes through app
    messages. A common example is mempool gossiping.

Currently, DijetsNodeGo implements its own message serialisation to communicate.
In the future, DijetsNodeGo will use protocol buffers to communicate.

### Network

[The networking
interface](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/network/network.go)
is shared across all chains. It implements functions from the `ExternalSender`
interface. The two functions it implements are `Send` and `Gossip`. `Send` sends
a message of type `OutboundMessage` to a specific set of nodes (specified by an
array of `NodeIDs`). `Gossip` sends a message of type `OutboundMessage` to a
random group of nodes in a Subnetwork (can be a validator or a non-validator).
Gossiping is used to push transactions across the network. The networking
protocol uses TLS to pass messages between peers.

Along with sending and gossiping, the networking library is also responsible for
making connections and maintaining connections. Any node, either a validator or
non-validator, will attempt to connect to the primary network.

## Router

[The
`ChainRouter`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/snow/networking/router/chain_router.go)
routes all incoming messages to its respective blockchain using `ChainID`. It
does this by pushing all the messages onto the respective Chain handlerâ€™s queue.
The `ChainRouter` references all existing chains on the network such as the
Value Chain, Utility Chain, Method Chain and possibly any other chain. The `ChainRouter`
handles timeouts as well. When sending messages on the P2P layer, timeouts are
registered on the sender and cleared on the `ChainRouter` side when a response
is received. If no response is received, then it triggers a timeout. Because
timeouts are handled on the `ChainRouter` side, the handler is reliable.
Timeouts are triggered when peers do not respond and the `ChainRouter` will
still notify the handler of failure cases. The timeout manager within
`ChainRouter` is also adaptive. If the network is experiencing long latencies,
timeouts will then be adjusted as well.

## Handler

The main function of [the
`Handler`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/snow/networking/handler/handler.go)
is to pass messages from the network to the consensus engine. It receives these
messages from the `ChainRouter`. It passes messages by pushing them onto a sync
or Async queue (depends on message type). Messages are then popped from the
queue, parsed, and routed to the correct function in consensus engine. This can
be one of the following.

- **State sync message (sync queue)**
- **Bootstrapping message (sync queue)**
- **Consensus message (sync queue)**
- **App message (Async queue)**

## Sender

The main role of [the
`sender`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/snow/networking/sender/sender.go)
is to build and send outbound messages. It is actually a very thin wrapper
around the normal networking code. The main difference here is that sender
registers timeouts and tells the router to expect a response message. The timer
starts on the sender side. If there is no response, sender will send a failed
response to the router. If a node is repeatedly unresponsive, that node will get
benched and the sender will immediately start marking those messages as failed.
If a sufficient amount of network deems the node benched, it might not get
rewards (as a validator).

## Consensus Engine

Consensus is defined as getting a group of distributed systems to agree on an
outcome. In the case of the Dijets network, consensus is achieved when
validators are in agreement with the state of the blockchain. 
Dijets Consensus is a refined iteration of the HotStuff consensus protocol.
The engine is responsible for adding and proposing a new block to consensus,
repeatedly polling the network for decisions (accept/reject), and communicating
that decision to the `Sender`.

## Blockchain Creation

[The
`Manager`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/blob/master/chains/manager.go)
is what kick-starts everything with regards to blockchain creation, starting with
the Method Chain. Once the Method Chain finishes bootstrapping, it will kickstart Utility Chain
and Value Chain and any other chains. The Manager's job is not done yet, if a
create-chain transaction is seen by a validator, a whole new process to create a
chain will be started by the `Manager`. This can happen dynamically, long after
the 3 chains in the Primary Network have been created and bootstrapped.
