NFT metadata is the set of data that makes up the content of a given NFT. For a typical NFT, metadata can include the description, 
name, traits, link to the hosted image etc. This information is often specified in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

# Preparing NFT Files for an ERC721 Smart Contract

This tutorial details the process of uploading and preparing the NFT Files such as the image and its metadata
so it can be used in smart contracts.

In this example, the files will get uploaded to
[Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/), a pinning service that prevents files from
being garbage collected on IPFS. If you don't already have an account, please
create one.

## Preparing the Images

This tutorial will create only 1 NFT, however, if you're interested in creating
more, you're more than welcome to do so. The image I'm using is linked here if
you'd like to use it.

![Original NFT Photo](/docs/img/nft-file.jpeg)

Place your image file in a folder on your computer. Name this image `0`, so
it'll be the first image pulled from the smart contract. it'll be the first (and
only) NFT in this collection, however, if you're adding more images you'd
continue naming them in sequential numeric order. you'll upload this folder to
Pinata once your images are organized and named correctly.

<Admonition type="info">

The choice of numbering your files depends upon you. A projects start file names can be `0`, and also `1`.
Whatever you decide, be sure that it's consistent with the smart contract code. To be consistent with
[this ERC-721 tutorial](intro-to-erc721s.md), we'll name this file `0`.

</Admonition>

After you log into Pinata, you'll see your dashboard. you'll see the upload
button on the left. Click `Upload`

![Pinata Dashboard](/docs/img/nft-3.png)

Select `Folder` option from the dropdown.

![Folder Button](/docs/img/nft-4.png)

You'll then select the folder that the image is in. You may get a pop-up from
your browser confirming you want to upload the folder and the files in it. If
you do, confirm by clicking `Upload`.

![Confirm Upload](/docs/img/nft-5.png)

You'll then be prompted to name the folder you've uploaded. This is beneficial
when you have several sets of folders uploaded to Pinata and are trying to keep
them organized. For the this example we will name the folder `blue-sphere`

![Confirm Upload](/docs/img/nft-6.png)

After giving it a name, click `Upload` and wait for your file to
upload. The quantity and size of the images could affect the upload time, but if
you're starting small, it should only take a few seconds.

Once the upload is complete, you'll see your folder in your dashboard.

![Confirm Upload](/docs/img/nft-7.png)

If you click on the folder name, it'll redirect you to the Pinata gateway to be
able to view your newly uploaded files. If you have a paid Pinata account, it'll
open the folder through your own gateway. Having a paid plan and personal
gateway is NOT required for this tutorial but is recommended to have for larger
collection sizes and hosting multiple folders.

You can copy the CID of the image by clicking on the file name. Or you can click on the
eye icon to preview the file which should open up a new tab with the full URL in the address bar. This URL is
important. Copy this down to use in the next step as we set up the metadata. For
this example, our URL is
`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUTHR8JWdfsGrWT4Xf7TYvMSU7gKMpxxQNHpTjzhTtpXW/0.png`

## Preparing the Metadata

Now that we have the image uploaded and its URL, we can create the matching metadata file for it.

Where this NFT is going to be an ERC-721, we know we can use metadata standards
often found on Marketplaces such as [Opensea](https://opensea.io). The
.json file below is an example of what the
[metadata](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure)
should look like.

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "tokenId": 0,
  "image": "",
  "description": "",
  "attributes": []
}
```

Let's populate the values into the metadata file. You can choose any `name`
and `description` that you want.

The `tokenId` here will be `0` so that it corresponds to the image we just
uploaded. If uploading multiple files, this needs to be incremented sequentially for each
file.

The `image` link is the URL we saved from the last step of the previous section.
Paste that link here so the smart contract knows where to find the image file
for your NFT. If uploading multiple files, the end of the URL (the specific
image) needs to increment in each file.

The `attributes` field isn't quite as important here, but if you were uploading
NFTs with several layers, the attributes would be the information of those
specific layers. This is often used when calculating the rarity of NFTs to be
able to rank them by how frequently their layers appear throughout the entire
collection. We will not be using the attributes field in this tutorial.

Below is the metadata file now populated with all the required fields for the image we uploaded earlier

```json
{
  "name": "Blue Sphere",
  "tokenId": 0,
  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUTHR8JWdfsGrWT4Xf7TYvMSU7gKMpxxQNHpTjzhTtpXW/0.png",
  "description": "Apollo 13 image of earth"
}
```

When saving this file, you want it to share the same name as the image it
corresponds to. In this case, it is 0.

Once the metadata file is uploaded to Pinata, the file extension will actually
not be needed. it'll search for the file as a directory and be able to pull its
information from there. To remove the file extension, follow these steps for a
[Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/show-or-hide-filename-extensions-on-mac-mchlp2304/mac)
environment, or these for a
[Windows](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-remove-file-extensions)
environment.

Now that the file extension has been removed, place it in another folder as you
did with the image file. They need to be SEPARATE folders.

![Metadata Folder](/docs/img/nft-8.png)

You'll now repeat the folder upload process to add the metadata to Pinata.
Follow the same steps as above. Once completed, you'll have both folders
available on your dashboard.

![Uploaded Folders](/docs/img/nft-9.png)

Click on the eye icon next to the folder name to be directed to the IPFS gateway and save the
URL. This URL will be your base URL and won't need the direct file links. The
smart contract will append the necessary file information for each NFT as
needed. For example, my URL is
`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXws4c743FbbVxAL8m5JHwjTa1XCctjJfgyXifVPzGyyw`.

Now that the image and metadata files are ready, we can prepare to deploy a
smart contract by following this [ERC-721 tutorial](intro-to-erc721s.md).
