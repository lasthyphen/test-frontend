Dijets JavaScript
library, allows developers to interact with DijetsNodeGo instances, invoke
Dijets Platform Functions and issue commands to the node APIs.

The APIs currently supported by default are:

The APIs currently supported by default are:

- Authentication API
- Admin API
- Value Chain API
- Utility Chain API
- Method Chain API
- Healthcheck API
- Index API
- Info API
- Keystore API
- Metrics API
- Socket API

DijetsJS was built to simplify development on Dijets. Using this library, any JavaScript
developer is able to interact with a Dijets Node instance where the API endpoints have 
been enabled for the developerâ€™s consumption.

DijetsJS enables developers to:

- Manage private keys locally
- Get UTXOs for specified addresses
- Retrieve balances of addresses
- Build and sign transactions
- Issue signed transactions on any of Dijets Ternary Chain Ledgers
- Create a Subnetwork or an Enterprise Consortia Chain
- Swap native DJTX & other assets between the Ternary Chains
- Add a Validator to the Dijets network
- Add a Delegator to the Dijets network
- Develop, test and manage a local node
- Retrieve Dijets network information from a node instance

## Requirements

DijetsJS requires Node.js version 14.18.0 or higher to compile.

<Admonition type="info">
You can use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install the required node version on your system
</Admonition>

### Installation

You can install DijetJs as a package using npm or yarn

<Tabs
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="npm"
>
  <TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

    ```sh Terminal
    npm install dijets
    ```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel id="yarn" label="Yarn">

    ```sh Terminal
    yarn add dijets
    ```

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

You can also pull the repo down directly

```Terminal
git clone https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsjs
```

 and build it from scratch:

`npm run build`

This will generate a pure JavaScript library and place it in a folder named
"web" in the project root. The "dijetsjs" file can then be dropped into any
project as a pure JavaScript implementation of Dijets.

The DijetsJS library can be imported into your existing Node.js project as follows:

```ts
const dijets = require("dijets")
```

Or into your TypeScript project like this:

```ts
import { Dijets } from "dijets"
```

## Importing Essentials

```ts
import { Dijets, BinTools, Buffer, BN } from "dijets"

let bintools = BinTools.getInstance()
```

The above lines import the libraries used in the tutorials. These libraries include:

- dijets: The JavaScript module.
- bn.js: Big number module used by DijetsJS.
- buffer: A Buffer library.
- BinTools: A singleton built into DijetsJS that is used for dealing with binary data.
