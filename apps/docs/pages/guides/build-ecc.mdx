Dijets makes it simple to create ECCs that can instantaneously confirm transactions and process thousands of transactions per second, 
vastly outperforming Ethereum and many other decentralized blockchain platforms.

# Build Your First ECC

The first step of building your ECC is to familiarise yourself with [Dijets-CLI]().

Dijets-CLI is a command line tool that gives developers access to all of ECC's composability, deployment, configuration and customisability.

Once installed, the Dijets-CLI binary makes the whole process of building & deploying ECCs on Dijets network a simple matter of issuing a few commands.
This powerful CLI tool specializes in helping developers develop, simulate, stress test, build and deploy ECCs with various different default configurations
or help completely tailor-made VMs.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of using Dijets-CLI for the first time by creating an ECC,
deploying it to the local test network, and finally connecting your newly created network to Metamask.

<Admonition type="info">

  Remember to add Dijets-CLI to your $GOPATH Once its in your path you can call the program anywhere from your system
  simply with just the word `dijets`

  </Admonition>

You can add Dijets-CLI to your path by running:

```bash
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

To add it to your path permanently, add the above export command to your shell initialisation script
(ex: .bashrc or .zshrc).

## Create Your ECC Configuration

There are a number of pre-built VMs that
an organisation can choose from or build an entirely bespoke VM with custom confirguration. For this tutorial we will be building an ECC based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Much like Dijets Utility Chain, since this ECC implements EVM, it supports Solidity smart contracts as well as most other Ethereum client functionality out of the box.

  Dijets Utility Chain is also an instance of Ethereum Virtual Machine with some refinements to suit the Primary Network requirements.

## Notable features of the ECC

1. Supports most of Ethereum's default API namespaces like `eth` `personal` `txpool` `debug` etc.
1. Fully compatible with almost all of Ethereum tooling, including Remix, Metamask and Truffle.
1. Configurable Gas fees and limits.
1. Supports Airdrop functionality (Airdrops can be used to assign an amount of the ECCs native token exclusively to whitelisted members of the organisation).
1. Tokenomics with custom fee tokens.
1. Multiple stateful pre-compiles. [Learn more about the Pre-Compiles]()
1. Fully confirgurable Genesis.


To start building your ECC, we need to submit our very first command to `Dijets-CLI`

The CLI tool then
starts collecting all the information required to create a definitive configuration of our ECC. This configuration or the blueprint of your ECC will form
the basis to how your blockchain behaves.

There are a number of tools contained within Dijets-CLI for developing and deploying ECCs. Each one adding more depth and refinement to your configuration. 
The `ECC-Doctor` tool for example simplifies the builds by walking you through each step of the process of creating your ECC. 

Let's get started by
first picking the name for our ECC. This tutorial uses `Mimo` as the name of the ECC, but feel free to substitute that
with any name you like. Once you've decided on the name of your ECC and network, run

`dijets ecc create mimo`

This command invokes `Dijets-CLI` CLI to start gathering all the information it needs to build the
configuration for your ECC.

The CLI tool starts with asking you a series of questions.
The following section walks you through each of those questions.

### Choose Your VM

Select `ECC-EVM`.

### Enter Your ECC's ChainID

Choose a positive integer for your EVM-style ChainID.

In production environments, this ChainID needs to be unique and not shared with any other chain.
Because this is a development ECC, feel free to pick any number. Do not pick
ChainIDs such as 1 (Ethereum) or 98200 (Dijets Utility Chain) as those may cause issues with other
tools.

### Token Symbol

Enter a string to name your ECC's native token. The token symbol doesn't necessarily need to be unique.
Example token symbols are DJTX, ROG, DCY MST etc

### ECC-EVM Version

Select `Use latest version`.

### Gas Fee Configuration

This question determines how to set gas fees on your ECC.

Select `Low disk use / Low Throughput 1.5 mil gas/s (This is the same setting Dijets Utility Chain uses)`.

### Airdrop

For the purpose of simplicity in this tutorial, we will:

Select `Airdrop 1 million tokens to the default address (do not use in production)`.

<Admonition type="info">
The default address the CLI mentions above is the account address strictly used for testing only. The private key of the address is well-known,
and can be found all across these documentation so DO NOT send any real funds to this address. Attackers
would most likely drain all the funds instantly.
</Admonition>

When building an ECC for production or for more indepth testing, select `Customize your airdrop` to distribute the native tokens
to other addresses.

### Precompiles

Precompiles help customise the behavior of your ECC. They're strictly an
advanced feature, so we can safely select `No` for now.

### Wrapping Up

If all worked successfully, the command prints `Successfully created ECC configuration`.

By successfully creating your ECC's configuration. You've finished the building process and can now go ahead and deploy
it to start interacting with your new blockchain.
