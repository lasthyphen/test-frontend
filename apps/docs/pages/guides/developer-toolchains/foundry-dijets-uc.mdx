## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy and interact with smart contracts using foundry
on a local Dijets Utility Chain running on a local test network.

[Foundry toolchain](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a smart contract
development toolchain written in Rust. It manages your dependencies, compiles
your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the
command-line.

## Recommended Knowledge

- Basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) and Dijets.
- You are familiar with [Dijets Smart Contract Guide Repo](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contracts-guide).
- Basic understanding of the [Dijets's architecture](platform)
- Understand the purpose and how to complete an IntraChain transfer in Dijets 

## Requirements

- You have [installed
  Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation). This
  installation includes the `forge` and `cast` binaries used in this
  walk-through.

### DijetsNodeGo and Dijets Network Runner

[DijetsNodeGo](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego) is a Dijets node
implementation written in Go. 

[Dijets Network Runner](dijets-up) is a tool to quickly
deploy local test networks. Together, you can deploy local test networks and run
tests on them.

Start a local five node Dijets network:

```text
cd /path/to/dijets-up
# start a five node staking network
./go run examples/local/fivenodenetwork/main.go
```

## Getting Started

This section will walk you through creating an [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) Token.

<Admonition type="info">

  ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique.

</Admonition>

### Clone Dijets Smart Contracts Guide Repo

Clone the [quickstart
repository](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contracts-guide) and
install the necessary packages via `yarn`.

```text
git clone https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contracts-guide.git
cd dijets-smart-contracts-guide
yarn
```

In order to deploy contracts, you need to have some test DJTX in your wallet. You can get testnet
DJTX from [Dijets Faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io), that transfers a small amount of test DJTX tokens for
you to play around with.

## Write Contracts

We’ll use a sample ERC721 contract to track items in our game, which will each have their own unique attributes. 
Whenever one is to be awarded to a player, it will be minted and sent to them. 
Players are free to keep their token or trade it with other people as they see fit, as they would any other asset on the blockchain
The smart contract is in the repo we cloned earlier for this example
[`GameNFT.sol`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contract-guide/blob/master/contracts/GameNFT.sol)
found in `./contracts` folder.

```ts
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// contracts/ERC721.sol

pragma solidity >=0.6.2;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract GameNFT is ERC721 {
  using Counters for Counters.Counter;
  Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

  constructor() ERC721("GameItem", "GMT") {}
  // 

  // commented out unused variable
  // function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI)
  function awardItem(address player)
    public
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _tokenIds.increment();

    uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
    _mint(player, newItemId);
    // _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

    return newItemId;
  }
}
```

Let's examine this implementation of an NFT as a Game Item. We start by
importing to contracts from our node modules. We import OpenZeppelin's open
source implementation of the [ERC721
standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721) which
our NFT contract will inherit from. Our constructor takes the `_name` and
`_symbol` arguments for our NFT and passes them on to the constructor of the
parent ERC721 implementation. Lastly we implement the `awardItem` function which
allows anyone to mint an NFT to a player's wallet address. This function
increments the `currentTokenId` and makes use of the `_mint` function of our
parent contract.

## Compile & Deploy with Forge

[Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-build.html) is a
command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your
smart contracts.

To compile the NFT contract run:

```text
forge build
```

By default the compiler output will be in the `out` directory. To deploy our
compiled contract with Forge we need to:

1. Set environment variables for the RPC endpoint.
1. Specify the private key with test DJTX to deploy the contract.

Set your environment variables by running:

```text
export RPC_URL=<YOUR-RPC-ENDPOINT>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>
```

Since we are deploying to a local testnet, our `RPC_URL` export should be:

```text
export RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

Once set, you can [deploy your NFT with
Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create.html) by running
the command below while adding the values for `_name` and `_symbol`, the
relevant [constructor
arguments](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contract-guide/blob/master/contracts/GameNFT.sol#L13)
of the NFT contract:

```text
forge create NFT --rpc-url=$RPC_URL --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY --constructor-args GameItem GMT
```

Upon successful deployment, you will see the deploying wallet's address, the
contract's address as well as the transaction hash printed in our terminal.

Here's an example output from an NFT deployment.

```text
[⠔] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Deployed to: 0x52c84043cd9c865236f11d9fc9f56aa003c1f922
Transaction hash: 0xf35c40dbbdc9e4298698ad1cb9937195e5a5e74e557bab1970a5dfd42a32f533
```

_Note: Please store your `Deployed to` address for use in the next section._

## Using Cast to Interact with the Smart Contract

We can call functions on our NFT contract with
[Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send.html), Foundry's
command-line tool for interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions,
and getting chain data. In this scenario, we will mint a Game Item to a player's
wallet using the [`awardItem`
function](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-smart-contract-guide/blob/master/contracts/GameNFT.sol#L17)
in our smart contract.

Mint an NFT from your contract by replacing `<NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS>` with your
`Deployed to` address and `<NFT-RECIPIENT-ADDRESS>` with an address of your
choice.

<Admonition type="info">

 This section assumes that you have already set your RPC and private key env variables during deployment_

</Admonition>

```text
cast send --rpc-url=$RPC_URL  <NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS> "awardItem(address)" <NFT-RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY
```

Upon successful completion, the command line will display the transaction data.

Thats it! You just minted your first NFT from your contract using Cast from Foundry. You can check the
owner of `tokenId` 1 by running the `cast call` command below:

```zsh
cast call --rpc-url=$RPC_URL --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY <NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS> "ownerOf(uint256)" 1
```

The address you provided above should be returned as the owner.

```zsh
0x000000000000000000000000845095a03a6686e24b90fed55e11f4ec808b1ab3
