# Create an ERC-20 Token Using Solidity

In this tutorial we will be creating our own mintable ERC-20 token and will mint it to
any address we want. The token will be generated on Dijets Utility Chain.

The article focuses on deploying a smart contract written with Solidity to
Dijets. This is the feature that Dijets provides us - to be able to deploy
any smart contract to the chain and no requirement for a new language specific
contract concept to interact. Let’s look at how to create an ERC-20 contract and
deploy it on Dijets Utility Chain.

## Set up MetaMask

The first thing we should set is a MetaMask wallet address.

Click on MetaMask icon on the browser and select the network drop-down menu.
Here we can connect to Dijets Utility Chain. Click "Custom RPC".

Fill in the fields with the information provided below.

- **Network Name**: Dijets Utility Chain
- **New RPC URL**: https://dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:443/ext/bc/C/rpc
- **ChainID**: `98200`
- **Symbol**: DJTX
- **Explorer**: [`https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/`](https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/)

After setting up all the parameters correctly we should have our Metamask connected to Dijets Utility Chain and a wallet address we can use to deploy our contract.

## Fund Your Utility Chain Address

For funding on Dijets Testnet, you can use the Test Network Faucet. Navigate
to [Dijets Faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io) and paste your
Utility Chain address.

## Create Mintable Token

Now, we can create our mintable token on Tinker. Open Tinker on your browser or go
to [this
link](https://tinker.dijets.io/dijets-ide/).

On this page, first, click "SOLIDITY" from "Featured
Plugins" and then click the "New File" button. When you click the New File
button, you will see a pop-up that requires a file name. You can choose a name
or leave the default.

Since we will use an ERC-20 contract from
[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/), just paste this line to the
file and save.

```jsx
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/presets/ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol";
```

After saving the file, we will see a bunch of files being imported into Tinker.
These files are imported from a GitHub contract repository
to Tinker via a URL-link with an import statement.

We have ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol file in the presets. This file is from
OpenZeppelin's repo and follows the ERC20 standards with minting functionality.

The minter functionality declares the deployer (unless specified) of the contract
as its owner thus giving him/her the authority to mint tokens.

Since in this example we are deploying the contract ourselves using our private key and address,
we will be the owner of the contract and thus have the
ability to mint the tokens.

## Deploy the Contract

Open the tab with the label `Compiler` and select the solidity version that
matches with the solidity version written in file as `pragma solidity …..`. The
version should be equal to or higher than the file’s version. For example, in our
file the version stated on the top of the contract is `pragma solidity ^0.6.0`
so the required version we need to pick should be 0.6.0 or
higher.

After checking the solidity version click the compile button. If you did not
change anything in the file, or the solidity version is not wrong, the contract
should compile without any errors.

Now click the tab with label `Deploy & run transactions`. Here before
deploying our contract, we should change the environment. Click the
environment tab and select "Injected Web3." If a Decypher or Metamask pop-up shows up and asks you to
connect the account, then please go ahead and click connect. Once connected you should see your
address listed under environment.

The last step before deployment is to select the correct contract from a dropdown section
placed just above the `Deploy` button. Select the contract named `ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol`.
You will see a section asking you to fill out the main details of your token, often called
the constructor arguments.

For this example we will name the token "test" with the symbol
`tst`. Click the `Transact` button.

A pop-up from Decypher or Metamask (depending upon what you are using) will ask you for signing
and confirming the transaction. Once you confirm the pop-ups, the transaction will be execcuted and the smart
contract will be deployed to Dijets Utility Chain.

Now that the contract has been deployed, we can start interacting with it.

## Interact with Token

In order to interact with the token contract we first need to find its address called the Contract Address.
You can find the contract address by going to Tinker's console and
clicking the arrow to expand the text. You should now be able to see the transaction hash of the contract we deployed earlier. 
Copy the transaction hash.

Paste the copied transaction hash into the [Explorer's Search Bar](https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/) and press enter.

This page is the transaction summary page detailing all the information about the transaction that deployed our Token contract.

The first address on the page is the wallet address that created the token and deployed the contract and the second address is
the contract address for the token `test`. 

After deployment a new section named `Deployed Contracts` should now be available on Tinker.

This section contains all of the functions that we call and use to interact with our token
contract. Let's use the `mint` function to get some tokens minted to our address.

Click the arrow beside the mint method and enter your address and the amount of tokens you wish to mint
in `wei`. For example, if you wish to mint 1000 `tst` tokens, then the amount in wei for `1000` should be entered 
as `1000000000000000000000`

## Add Token to MetaMask

Even though we have minted `1000 tst` tokens to our address. The token will only
be visible in Metamask once we specify its contract address and import it.

To import our 1000 tokens we just minted, click `Import Tokens` tab under `Assets` in Metamask.
Under Custom Token -> Token Contract address paste the contract address of the token we copied earlier.

The rest of the details like the token name `test` and its symbol `tst` will automatically get populated.
Click Next and you should now be able to see your 1000 test tokens within the Metamask wallet.
