## Overview

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of how to
integrate with Dijets Utility Chain. An EVM-Compatible instance of Dijets Ternary Chain Ledger system. 
Supporting and integrating with Dijets Utility Chain is as straightforward as spinning up a
Dijets Node (which has the [same API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) as
[`go-ethereum`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)) and inputting the correct Chain ID
for Dijets i.e 98200 when constructing transactions.

## Integration Using EVM Endpoints

### Running a Dijets Node

If you want to build your node form source or include it in a docker image,
reference the [DijetsNodeGo GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego).

### Configuring a Dijets Node

All configuration options and their default values are described [here]().

You can supply configuration options on the command line, or use a config file,
which can be easier to work with when supplying many options. You can specify
the config file location with `â€”config-file=config.json`, where `config.json` is
a JSON file whose keys and values are option names and values.

Individual chains, including the Utility Chain, have their own configuration options
which are separate from the node-level options. These can also be specified in a
config file. For more details, see
[here]().

The Utility Chain config file should be at
`$HOME/.dijetsnodego/configs/chains/C/config.json`. You can also tell DijetsNodeGo
to look somewhere else for the Utility Chain config file with option
`--chain-config-dir`. An example Utility Chain config file:

If you need Ethereum [Archive
Node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#archive-node)
functionality, you need to disable the Utulity Chain pruning option. To disable pruning, include
`"pruning-enabled": false` in the Utility Chain's config file as shown below.

```json
{
  "cacid-api-enabled": false,
  "local-txs-enabled": true,
  "pruning-enabled": false,
  "coreth-admin-api-enabled": false,
  "eth-apis": [
    "internal-eth",
    "internal-blockchain",
    "internal-transaction",
    "internal-tx-pool",
    "internal-account",
    "internal-personal",
    "debug-tracer",
    "web3",
    "eth",
    "eth-filter",
    "admin",
    "net"
  ]
}
```

### Interacting with the Utility Chain

Interacting with the Utility Chain is identical to interacting with
[`go-ethereum`](https://geth.ethereum.org/). You can find the reference material
for Utility Chain API [here]().

## Constructing Transactions

Dijets Utility Chain transactions are identical to standard EVM transactions with 2 main exceptions:

1. They must be signed with Dijets ChainID (98200).
1. The detailed dynamic gas fee can be found [here](transaction-fees#utility-chain-fees).

For development purposes, Dijets supports all the popular tooling for
Ethereum, so developers familiar with Ethereum and Solidity can feel right at
home. Tools like Remix, Truffle, Ganache work out of the box with Dijets Utility Chain.

## Ingesting On-Chain Data

You can use any standard way of ingesting on-chain data that you currently use for Ethereum network.

### Determining Finality

One of the most notable and differentiating features of Dijets is its sub-second finality.
Dijets consensus provides fast and irreversible finality guaranteed within 1-2 seconds. To
query the most up-to-date finalized block, query any value (that is block, balance,
state, etc) with the `latest` parameter. 

If you end up querying above the last finalized
block (that is eth_blockNumber returns 10 and you query 11), an error will be
thrown indicating that unfinalized data cannot be queried.

If you plan on reading JSON responses directly or use web3.js (doesn't recompute
hash received over the wire) to extract on-chain transaction data/logs/receipts,
then you shouldn't have any issues integrating Dijets Utility Chain.

## Support

developers, or on our public support room on [Qowalts](https://redirect.dijets.io/#/#dijets-support:dijets.org).
