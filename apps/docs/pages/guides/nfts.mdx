## Introduction

Non-fungible tokens, or NFT, are digital assets that are provably unique. 
They can be used to represent both tangible and intangible items. Each NFT Token
contains identifying information recorded in smart contracts. It’s precisely this information 
that makes a token - non-fungible and as such, they cannot be directly replaced by another token. 

## ERC-721 (NFT) Smart Contracts

This tutorial guides you through a basic [ERC-721
(NFT)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) smart contract on Dijets
Test Network. We'll deploy our
NFT on the test networks utility chain and view it on the explorer.
These NFTs aren't transferable to Dijets Mainnet. However, once you feel
comfortable launching your NFT project, you can do so on Dijets Mainnet and list
it on an NFT marketplace.

Note that the following tools will be used during this tutorial. It is thus presumed that
you chave access to each one of them.

- [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/): To store your NFT images and metadata.
- [OpenZeppelin’s Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/): to create the ERC-721 smart contract.
- [Tinker IDE](https://tinker.dijets.io/): To edit the code and deploy it to Dijets TestNet.
- [Dijets Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io/): To fund the deployment.
- [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn): To process transactions related to funding and deploying the smart contract.
- [Dijets Utility Chain Explorer](https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/): To view the deployed smart contract.

This Solidity smart contract tutorial is for demonstration purposes
only. Users should consider proper precautions, error handling, and safeguards
for production use. No one at Dijets is responsible for your development, and
you must take full responsibility for ensuring your code is secure.

## Preparing Your NFT Files

The first step of setting up an NFT smart contract is having your NFT files
ready to use. In this example, the files will get uploaded to Pinata, a pinning
service that prevents files from being garbage collected on IPFS.

If you're unfamiliar with the process of uploading image and metadata files to
an IPFS provider for NFT collection usage, please have a read through [this guide on
preparing NFT files](nft-metadata). Ensure that your files are
uploaded and your base URI is ready to plug into your smart contract.

Once the image and metadata files are ready, we can prepare to deploy a smart contract.

## Preparing Your Environment

### MetaMask Extension

You'll need the MetaMask Extension installed on whatever browser you're using to
be able to fund the deployment of the smart contract. If you've not done so
already, download MetaMask and [add Dijets Network to MetaMask](/docs/guides/add-dijets-programmatically). Create or import Dijets account as necessary.

### Getting Testnet Funds

Because we're deploying on the Dijets TestNet, you'll need to get DJTX on Dijets Testnet. 
Please visit [Dijets Faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io/), where you
can request up to 2 DJTX per day for testing. These DJTX tokens have no monetary value and are only for development purposes only.
Enter your Utility Chain address of the
account linked to your MetaMask in the previous step to get the testnet DJTX.

## Creating the Smart Contract

To create the smart contract, we're going to use [Open
Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/). Open Zeppelin is a key tool for
building smart contracts quickly and easily. While we're only scratching the
surface in this tutorial, OpenZeppelin has amazing documentation available on their website for
you to read when you want to build more complex contracts.

Open Zeppelin provides a [Contract
Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) that can help with building out
ERC contracts. In the interest of keeping this tutorial beginner-friendly, we'll use the contract wizard to
create our ERC-721 contract.

![Contract Wizard](/docs/img/openzeppelin.png)

Select `ERC-721` on the Contract Wizard to get started. This will create the
contract in [Solidity programming
language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/).

As you can see, the template contract is bare-boned. We'll fill out the
information in the left panel to auto-populate it into our contract. Make sure
you change to the ERC-721 tab as you get started to make the proper contract.

The Wizard auto-fills in a name and symbol for your NFT collection, which we'll
modify here. I'm naming it `Photography` and giving it the symbol `FOTO`. If you
chose your own files to use during this tutorial, you can choose a relevant name
and symbol for your collection.

The Base URI field listed here is the URL of the metadata folder uploaded to
Pinata(for example, using the same URL as the one we generated in the [tutorial for preparing the NFT files](nft-metadat)
`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUTHR8JWdfsGrWT4Xf7TYvMSU7gKMpxxQNHpTjzhTtpXW`).
Paste the URL into the Base URI field.

Next, we'll want to check the `Mintable` and `Auto Increment Ids` boxes. This
will populate a mint function into our template that would handle the
incrementing of token Ids on mint if we had more than one NFT in our
collection. We still want it to auto-assign our 1 NFT, so we'll check it.

This automatically checks the `Ownable` button, which gives the `safeMint`
function the `onlyOwner` modifier. This modifier indicates that only the owner
of the smart contract will be able to successfully call the function.

<Admonition type="info">

The `onlyOwner` modifier should be removed when creating a smart contract for a
public mint. Otherwise, users wouldn't be able to successfully mint the NFTs
when calling the `safeMint` function. Because this tutorial only handles the owner’s
wallet address, the modifier is being left in.

</Admonition>

This `safeMint` function also doubles as an airdrop function in our contract because the
address the NFT is minted to does not need to be the function owner. This
functionality is specially useful when NFT collection owners want to give away
NFTs for free outside of the normal minting window.

You can download or copy the smart contract code
and paste it in the Tinker IDE to start the deployment process.

## Deploying the Smart Contract with Tinker IDE

[Tinker IDE](https://tinker.dijets.io/) is a fork of Remix that allows you
to edit, compile, and deploy your smart contracts to Dijets Utility Chain by default. 
This will prevent you from
needing to download any other coding environments or having to change networks and keeps the deployment process pretty straight forward.

After pasting in or importing the smart contract code into Tinker IDE, the first thing you need to do is compile
it. Hit the `Compile` button on the left-hand side. You could also use the
keyboard shortcut `Ctrl / Command + S`.

Once completed, you'll see a green checkmark on the far left tab.
Next, you'll click on the bottom tab on the left-hand side to move to the
deployment page.

Since we will be using Metamask to sign and confirm the deploymeny transaction, Click on the `Environment` drop-down, and select `Injected
web3`.

This should prompt you to connect with your MetaMask account. Once connected,
you can verify the correct connection by checking that the Account number
matches your MetaMask address.

Now click on the `Contract` drop-down and select the contract you created and
compiled. It should show up with the name you gave it in the Open Zeppelin
Wizard. For our tutorial we used the name **BlueSphere**

Click Deploy. This will open MetaMask and ask you to confirm the transaction. Click `Confirm`.

It may take a second, but once completed, your newly deployed contract will
appear underneath the `Transactions Recorded` field.

Copy your contract’s address and open the [Dijets Utility Chain Explorer](https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/). 
Paste your contract address in the search bar, and click `Search`.

The first transaction you see should be the contract deployment you just did in
the Tinker IDE.

## Minting an NFT

Now that we have deployed the contract, we can mint the NFT. Go back to the
Tinker IDE tab and click on your contract to expand its information. A list of
functions will appear underneath each stating the function you can use to interact with
the deployed contract.

The only function we are interested in at the moment is the `safeMint` function. Click the
drop-down arrow for the function to expand the address field.

Copy your MetaMask address and paste it into this address field. This will
send the NFT to your address when the mint function has been called. Go ahead and Click
`transact`.

This will reopen MetaMask and ask you to verify the transaction. Click `Confirm` to mint your NFT.

Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll see a green checkmark in the
terminal at the bottom of the Tinker IDE.

Head back to the Dijets Utility Chain Explorer page for your contract and refresh
it. You should now see a second transaction, your call to `safeMint`.

By clicking on the transaction hash you can see that your NFT was created!
