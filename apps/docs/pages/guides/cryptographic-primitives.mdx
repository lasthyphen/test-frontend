Dijets uses a variety of cryptographic primitives for its different
functions. This file summarizes the type and kind of cryptography used at the
network and blockchain layers.

## Cryptography in the Network Layer

Dijets uses Transport Layer Security, TLS, to protect node-to-node
communications from eavesdroppers. TLS combines the practicality of public-key
cryptography with the efficiency of symmetric-key cryptography. This has
resulted in TLS becoming the standard for internet communication. Whereas most
classical consensus protocols employ public-key cryptography to prove receipt of
messages to third parties, the novel HotStuff consensus family does not require
such proofs. This enables Dijets to employ TLS in authenticating stakers and
eliminates the need for costly public-key cryptography for signing network
messages.

### TLS Certificates

Dijets does not rely on any centralized third-parties, and in particular, it
does not use certificates issued by third-party authenticators. All certificates
used within the network layer to identify endpoints are self-signed, thus
creating a self-sovereign identity layer. No third parties are ever involved.

### TLS Addresses

To avoid posting the full TLS certificate to the Platform chain, the certificate
is first hashed. For consistency, Dijets employs the same hashing mechanism
for the TLS certificates as is used in Bitcoin. Namely, the DER representation
of the certificate is hashed with sha256, and the result is then hashed with
ripemd160 to yield a 20-byte identifier for stakers.

This 20-byte identifier is represented by "NodeID-" followed by the data’s
CB58 encoded
string.

## Cryptography in Dijets Virtual Machine

The Dijets virtual machine uses elliptic curve cryptography, specifically
`secp256k1`, for its signatures on the blockchain.

This 32-byte identifier is represented by "PrivateKey-" followed by the data’s
CB58 encoded
string.

### Secp256k1 Addresses

Dijets is not prescriptive about addressing schemes, choosing to instead
leave addressing up to each blockchain.

The addressing scheme of the Value Chain and the Method Chain relies on secp256k1.
Dijets follows a similar approach as Bitcoin and hashes the ECDSA public key.
The 33-byte compressed representation of the public key is hashed with sha256
**once**. The result is then hashed with ripemd160 to yield a 20-byte address.

Dijets uses the convention `chainID-address` to specify which chain an
address exists on. `chainID` may be replaced with an alias of the chain. When
transmitting information through external applications, the CB58 convention is
required.

### Bech32

Addresses on the Value Chain and Method Chain use the
[Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) standard
outlined in [BIP 0173](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173). There are four
parts to a Bech32 address scheme. In order of appearance:

- A human-readable part (HRP). On Mainnet this is `dijets`.
- The number `1`, which separates the HRP from the address and error correction code.
- A base-32 encoded string representing the 20 byte address.
- A 6-character base-32 encoded error correction code.

The following regular expression matches addresses on the Value Chain, Method Chain and
Utility Chain for Mainnet, Testnet and localhost. Note that all valid Dijets addresses
will match this regular expression.

```text
^([XPC]|[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{36,72})-[a-zA-Z]{1,83}1[qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l]{38}$
```

### Secp256k1 Recoverable Signatures

Recoverable signatures are stored as the 65-byte **`[R || S || V]`** where
**`V`** is 0 or 1 to allow quick public key recoverability. **`S`** must be in
the lower half of the possible range to prevent signature malleability. Before
signing a message, the message is hashed using sha256.

## Signed Messages

A standard for interoperable generic signed messages based on the Bitcoin Script
format and Ethereum format.

```text
sign(sha256(length(prefix) + prefix + length(message) + message))
```

The prefix is simply the string `\x1ADijets Signed Message:\n`, where `0x1A`
is the length of the prefix text and `length(message)` is an
[integer](serialisation-primitives#integer) of the message size.


### Example

As an example we will sign the message "Pen xen ole fren"

```text
// prefix size: 26 bytes
0x1a
// prefix: Dijets Signed Message:\n
0x44 0x69 0x6a 0x65 0x74 0x73 0x20 0x53 0x69 0x67 0x6e 0x65 0x64 0x20 0x4d 0x65 0x73 0x73 0x61 0x67 0x65 0x3a 0x0a 0x0a 0x0a 0x0a
// msg size: 16 bytes
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x10
// msg: Pen xen ole fren
50 65 6e 20 78 65 6e 20 6f 6c 65 20 66 72 65 6e
```

After hashing with `sha256` and signing the pre-image we return the value
cb58 encoded:
`q8LMFYywox2jtMhS7fusHKYoezYMhf1pZPe7fsUERkFYZyzAvADCfA5d4nd2i8WWyRiXxWjDyiXwZsx6zp3B47NUDvx5mD`.

## Cryptography in Ethereum Virtual Machine

Dijets nodes support the full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and precisely
duplicates all of the cryptographic constructs used in Ethereum. This includes
the Keccak hash function and the other mechanisms used for cryptographic
security in the EVM.
