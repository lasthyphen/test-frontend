This guide shows how as a developer you can programmatically add Dijets Network to your DApps,
and in doing so make your onboarding process even more smoother for users.

## MetaMask

Adding a new network to MetaMask is not a trivial task for people that are not technically savvy. It can lead to more confusion and even worse, loss of funds.
To help easier onboarding of users to your application it is useful to simplify that process as much as possible.
This tutorial will show how to build a simple button in your front-end
application that will automate the process of adding Dijets Network to
MetaMask, the most widely used web 3.0 wallet & browser.

### EIP-3035 & MetaMask

[EIP-3035](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3085) is an [Ethereum Improvement
Proposal](https://eips.ethereum.org/) that defines an RPC method for adding
Ethereum-compatible chains to wallet applications.

Since March 2021 MetaMask has implemented EIP 3035 as part of their [Custom Networks API](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/connect-users-to-layer-2-networks-with-the-metamask-custom-networks-api/).

Before we begin the implementation, let's look at how this all works.

### Data Structures

To add Dijets network to MetaMask, we need to prepare the data structures
that will contain all the necessary data about the network.

Main network data:

```javascript
export const DIJETS_MAINNET_PARAMS = {
  chainId: "0x17F98",
  chainName: "Dijets Utility Chain",
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: "Dijets",
    symbol: "DJTX",
    decimals: 18,
  },
  rpcUrls: ["https://dijets.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:443/ext/bc/C/rpc"],
  blockExplorerUrls: ["https://utility-explorer.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com/"],
}
```

### Adding the Network

To add the network to MetaMask, we need to call the `wallet_addEthereumChain`
method, exposed by the web3 provider.

```javascript
function addDijetsNetwork() {
  injected.getProvider().then((provider) => {
    provider
      .request({
        method: "wallet_addEthereumChain",
        params: [DIJETS_MAINNET_PARAMS],
      })
      .catch((error: any) => {
        console.log(error)
      })
  })
}
```

Here `injected` is initialized as a `web3-react/injected-connector` which is used to
interface with MetaMask APIs. Usage for other popular web frameworks is similar.

Typical usage pattern would be to expose a button calling that method if you get
errors like `Wrong Network` or `Error connecting` when attempting to establish a
connection to MetaMask.

### User Experience

When users first come to your DApp they are prompted to approve connection to
MetaMask. Once the user approves the connection, and if no successful web3 network
connection is detected, you can present them with a dialog asking them to confirm switching to
a different network:

![wrong network](/docs/img/wrong-network-button.png)

If they press the button, they are shown a dialog from MetaMask asking for approval to add the new network:

![add a network](/docs/img/add-dijets-network.png)

If they approve, your app will be connected to Dijets Network.
Your users won't need to fill in long URLs or worry about inputting wrong information.
A seamless process designed to help your users avoid any confusion and hassle.

## Conclusion

Manually adding a new network is a
hurdle that a certain percentage of your potential users will not be able to
clear. Removing that requirement is a simple step that will enhance their
experience and enable more users who get to actually use your dapp.
