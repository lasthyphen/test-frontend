  description: 'The Value Chain is an instance of Dijets Virtual Machine for creating smart digital assets.',
}

The [Value Chain](/docs/guides/getting-started/introduction#value) is
Dijets native chain and platform for creating and trading smart digital assets. It is an instance of Dijets Virtual
Machine (DVM). This API allows clients to create and trade assets on the Value Chain and on other instances
of Dijets Virtual Machine.

## Format

The Value Chain API uses the standard `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see
[here](issuing-api-calls).

## Endpoints

`/ext/bc/X` to interact with the Value Chain.

`/ext/bc/blockchainID` to interact with other Dijets Virtual Machine instances, where `blockchainID` is the ID of a
blockchain running the VM.

## Methods

### Create Genesis Byte representation

Given a JSON representation of this Virtual Machine’s genesis state, create the byte representation
of that state.

#### **Endpoint**

This call is made to Dijets Virtual Machine's static API endpoint:

`/ext/vm/avm`

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.buildGenesis({
    networkID: int,
    genesisData: JSON,
    encoding: string, //optional
}) -> {
    bytes: string,
    encoding: string,
}
```

Encoding specifies the encoding format to use for arbitrary bytes, that is the genesis bytes that are
returned. Can only be `hex` when a value is provided.

`genesisData` has this form:

```json
{
"genesisData" :
    {
        "assetAlias1": {               // Each object defines an asset
            "name": "rogue",
            "symbol":"ROGE",           // Symbol is between 0 and 4 characters
            "initialState": {
                "fixedCap" : [         // Choose the asset type.
                    {                  // Can be "fixedCap", "variableCap", "limitedTransfer", "nonFungible"
                        "amount":1000, // At genesis, address A has
                        "address":"A"  // 1000 units of asset named rogue
                    },
                    {
                        "amount":3000, // At genesis, address B has
                        "address":"B"  // 3000 units of asset named rogue

                    },
                    ...                // Can have many initial holders
                ]
            }
        },
        "assetAliasCanBeAnythingUnique": { // Asset alias can be used in place of assetID in calls
            "name": "rogue", // names need not be unique
            "symbol": "ROGE",              // symbols need not be unique
            "initialState": {
                "variableCap" : [          // No units of the asset exist at genesis
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signature of A or B can mint more of
                            "A",           // the asset.
                            "B"
                        ],
                        "threshold":1
                    },
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signatures of 2 of A, B and C can mint
                            "A",           // more of the asset
                            "B",
                            "C"
                        ],
                        "threshold":2
                    },
                    ...                    // Can have many minter sets
                ]
            }
        },
        ...                                // Can list more assets

### Create new Asset with Fixed Cap

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Create a new fixed-cap, fungible asset. A quantity of it is created at initialization and then no
more is ever created. The asset can be sent with `avm.send`.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.createFixedCapAsset({
    name: string,
    symbol: string,
    denomination: int, //optional
    initialHolders: []{
        address: string,
        amount: int
    },
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) ->
{
    assetID: string,
    changeAddr: string
}
```

- `name` is a human-readable name for the asset. Not necessarily unique.
- `symbol` is a shorthand symbol for the asset. Between 0 and 4 characters. Not necessarily unique.
  May be omitted.
- `denomination` determines how balances of this asset are displayed by user interfaces. If
  `denomination` is 0, 100 units of this asset are displayed as 100. If `denomination` is 1, 100
  units of this asset are displayed as 10.0. If `denomination` is 2, 100 units of this asset are
  displayed as 1.00, etc. Defaults to 0.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.
- `username` and `password` denote the user paying the transaction fee.
- Each element in `initialHolders` specifies that `address` holds `amount` units of the asset at
  genesis.
- `assetID` is the ID of the new asset.

### Create NFTs

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Create a new non-fungible asset. No units of the asset exist at initialization. Minters can mint
units of this asset using `avm.mintNFT`.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.createNFTAsset({
    name: string,
    symbol: string,
    minterSets: []{

- `symbol` is a shorthand symbol for the asset. Between 0 and 4 characters. Not necessarily unique.
  May be omitted.
- `minterSets` is a list where each element specifies that `threshold` of the addresses in `minters`
  may together mint more of the asset by signing a minting transaction.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.

### Export Asset between chains

<Admonition type= "caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Send an asset from the Value Chain to the Method Chain or Utility Chain. After calling this method, you must call
the [Utility Chain's `djtx.import`](utility-chain-api#djtximport) or the [Method Chain's
`platform.importDJTX`](method-chain-api#platformimportdjtx) to complete the transfer.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.export({
    to: string,
    amount: int,
    assetID: string,
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string,
}) ->
{
    txID: string,
    changeAddr: string,
}
```

- `to` is the Method Chain or Utility Chain address the asset is sent to.
- `amount` is the amount of the asset to send.
- `assetID` is the asset id of the asset which is sent. Use `DJTX` for DJTX exports.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.
- The asset is sent from addresses controlled by `username`
- `password` is `username`‘s password.

- `txID` is this transaction’s ID.
- `changeAddr` in the result is the address where any change was sent.

**Example Call:**

### Export Private Key

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Get the private key that controls a given address. The returned private key can be added to a user
with [`dvm.importKey`](#dvmimportkey).

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.exportKey({
    username: string,
    password: string,
    address: string
}) -> {privateKey: string}
```

- `username` must control `address`.
- `privateKey` is the string representation of the private key that controls `address`.

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.exportKey",

### Get all Transactions for an Address

Returns all transactions that change the balance of the given address. A transaction is said to
change an address's balance if either is true:

- A UTXO that the transaction consumes was at least partially owned by the address.
- A UTXO that the transaction produces is at least partially owned by the address.

          }
        ]
      },
      "credentials": [
        {
          "fxID": "spdxUxVJQbX85MGxMHbKw1sHxMnSqJ3QBzDyDYEP3h6TLuxqQ",
          "credential": {
            "signatures": [
              "0x447ea3c6725add24e240b3179f9cc28ab5410c48f822d32d12459861ca816765297dbfe07e1957e3b470d39e6f56f10269dd7f8c4e108857db874b2c4ba1a22401"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "encoding": "json"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Where:

- `credentials` is a list of this transaction's credentials. Each credential proves that this
  transaction's creator is allowed to consume one of this transaction's inputs. Each credential is a
  list of signatures.
- `unsignedTx` is the non-signature portion of the transaction.
- `networkID` is the ID of the network this transaction happened on. (Dijets Mainnet is `1`.)
- `blockchainID` is the ID of the blockchain this transaction happened on. (Dijets Mainnet
  Value Chain is `hgBiUrBJkih9eoPkLtNaJKJQK8Fc2nmR6yuqkh9BmgNY2dJ3Y`.)
- Each element of `outputs` is an output (UTXO) of this transaction that is not being exported to
  another chain.
- Each element of `inputs` is an input of this transaction which has not been imported from another
  chain.
- Import Transactions have additional fields `sourceChain` and `importedInputs`, which specify the
  blockchain ID that assets are being imported from, and the inputs that are being imported.
- Export Transactions have additional fields `destinationChain` and `exportedOutputs`, which specify
  the blockchain ID that assets are being exported to, and the UTXOs that are being exported.

An output contains:

- `assetID`: The ID of the asset being transferred. (The Mainnet Djtx ID is
  `wjcHr7ng1qPXeJm5Mh3HzQxqz2S9AGo9UVP78jxh5zfirZxY7`.)
- `fxID`: The ID of the FX this output uses.
- `output`: The FX-specific contents of this output.

Most outputs use the secp256k1 FX, look like this:

```json
{
  "assetID": "wjcHr7ng1qPXeJm5Mh3HzQxqz2S9AGo9UVP78jxh5zfirZxY7",
  "fxID": "spdxUxVJQbX85MGxMHbKw1sHxMnSqJ3QBzDyDYEP3h6TLuxqQ",
  "output": {
    "addresses": ["X-dijets126rd3w35xwkmj8670zvf7y5r8k36qa9z9803wm"],
    "amount": 1530084210,
    "locktime": 0,
    "threshold": 1
  }
}
```

The above output can be consumed after Unix time `locktime` by a transaction that has signatures
from `threshold` of the addresses in `addresses`.

### `dvm.getTxStatus`

Get the status of a transaction sent to the network.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.getTxStatus({txID: string}) -> {status: string}
```

`status` is one of:

- `Accepted`: The transaction is (or will be) accepted by every node
- `Processing`: The transaction is being voted on by this node
- `Rejected`: The transaction will never be accepted by any node in the network
- `Unknown`: The transaction hasn’t been seen by this node

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getTxStatus",
    "params" :{
        "txID":"2QouvFWUbjuySRxeX5xMbNCuAaKWfbk5FeEa2JmoF85RKLk2dD"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "status": "Accepted"
  }
}
```

### `dvm.getUTXOs`

Gets the UTXOs that reference a given address. If `sourceChain` is specified, then it will retrieve
the atomic UTXOs exported from that chain to the X Chain.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.getUTXOs({
    addresses: []string,
    limit: int, //optional
    startIndex: { //optional
        address: string,
        utxo: string
    },
    sourceChain: string, //optional
    encoding: string //optional
}) -> {
    numFetched: int,
    utxos: []string,
    endIndex: {
        address: string,
        utxo: string
    },
    sourceChain: string, //optional
    encoding: string
}
```

- `utxos` is a list of UTXOs such that each UTXO references at least one address in `addresses`.
- At most `limit` UTXOs are returned. If `limit` is omitted or greater than 1024, it is set to 1024.
- This method supports pagination. `endIndex` denotes the last UTXO returned. To get the next set of
  UTXOs, use the value of `endIndex` as `startIndex` in the next call.
- If `startIndex` is omitted, will fetch all UTXOs up to `limit`.
- When using pagination (when `startIndex` is provided), UTXOs are not guaranteed to be unique
  across multiple calls. That is, a UTXO may appear in the result of the first call, and then again
  in the second call.
- When using pagination, consistency is not guaranteed across multiple calls. That is, the UTXO set
  of the addresses may have changed between calls.
- `encoding` sets the format for the returned UTXOs. Can only be `hex` when a value is provided.

#### **Example**

Suppose we want all UTXOs that reference at least one of
`X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5` and `X-dijets1d09qn852zcy03sfc9hay2llmn9hsgnw4tp3dv6`.

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{
        "addresses":["X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5", "X-dijets1d09qn852zcy03sfc9hay2llmn9hsgnw4tp3dv6"],
        "limit":5,
        "encoding": "hex"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

```json

    },
    "encoding": "hex"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Since `numFetched` is the same as `limit`, we can tell that there may be more UTXOs that were not
fetched. We call the method again, this time with `startIndex`:

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :2,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{

        "limit":5,
        "startIndex": {
            "address": "X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5",
            "utxo": "kbUThAUfmBXUmRgTpgD6r3nLj7rJUGho6xyht5nouNNypH45j"
        },
        "encoding": "hex"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",

Since `numFetched` is less than `limit`, we know that we are done fetching UTXOs and don’t need to
call this method again.

Suppose we want to fetch the UTXOs exported from the Method Chain to the Value Chain in order to build an
ImportTx. Then we need to call GetUTXOs with the `sourceChain` argument in order to retrieve the
atomic UTXOs:

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{
        "addresses":["X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5", "X-dijets1d09qn852zcy03sfc9hay2llmn9hsgnw4tp3dv6"],
        "limit":5,
        "sourceChain": "P",
        "encoding": "hex"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

### `dvm.import`

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Finalize a transfer of an asset from the Method Chain or Utility Chain to the Value Chain. Before this method is
called, you must call the Method Chain’s [`platform.exportDJTX`](method-chain-api#platformexportdjtx) or
Utility Chain’s [`djtx.export`](utility-chain-api#djtxexport) method to initiate the transfer.

**Signature:**

```sh
avm.import({
    to: string,
    sourceChain: string,
    username: string,
    password: string,
}) -> {txID: string}
```

- `to` is the address the DJTX is sent to. This must be the same as the `to` argument in the
  corresponding call to the Method Chain’s `exportDJTX` or Utility Chain's `export`.
- `sourceChain` is the ID or alias of the chain the DJTX is being imported from. To import funds
  from the Utility Chain, use `"C"`.
- `username` is the user that controls `to`.
- `txID` is the ID of the newly created atomic transaction.

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.import",
    "params" :{
        "to":"X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5",

### `wallet.issueTx`

Send a signed transaction to the network and assume the TX will be accepted. `encoding` specifies
the format of the signed transaction. Can only be `hex` when a value is provided.

This call is made to the wallet API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/wallet`

**Signature:**

```sh
wallet.issueTx({
    tx: string,
    encoding: string, //optional
}) -> {
    txID: string
}
```

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     : 1,
    "method" :"wallet.issueTx",
    "params" :{

### `wallet.send`

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Send a quantity of an asset to an address and assume the TX will be accepted so that future calls
can use the modified UTXO set.

This call is made to the wallet API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/wallet`

**Signature:**

```sh
wallet.send({
    amount: int,
    assetID: string,
    to: string,
    memo: string, //optional
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) -> {txID: string, changeAddr: string}
```

- Sends `amount` units of asset with ID `assetID` to address `to`. `amount` is denominated in the
  smallest increment of the asset. For DJTX this is 1 nDJTX (one billionth of 1 DJTX.)
- `to` is the Value Chain address the asset is sent to.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.
- You can attach a `memo`, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
- The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to
  hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"wallet.send",
    "params" :{
        "assetID"   : "DJTX",
        "amount"    : 10000,
        "to"        : "X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5",
        "memo"      : "penXenOleFren",
        "from"      : ["X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5"],
        "changeAddr": "X-dijets1turszjwn05lflpewurw96rfrd3h6x8flgs5uf8",
        "username"  : "userThatControlsAtLeast10000OfThisAsset",
        "password"  : "myPassword"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X/wallet
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "txID": "2iXSVLPNVdnFqn65rRvLrsu8WneTFqBJRMqkBJx5vZTwAQb8c1",
    "changeAddr": "X-dijets1turszjwn05lflpewurw96rfrd3h6x8flgs5uf8"
  }
}
```

### `wallet.sendMultiple`

<Admonition type="caution">
Not recommended for use on Mainnet. See warning notice in [Keystore API](./keystore.md).
</Admonition>

Send multiple transfers of `amount` of `assetID`, to a specified address from a list of owned of
addresses and assume the TX will be accepted so that future calls can use the modified UTXO set.

This call is made to the wallet API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/wallet`

**Signature:**

```sh
wallet.sendMultiple({
    outputs: []{
      assetID: string,
      amount: int,
      to: string
    },
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    memo: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) -> {txID: string, changeAddr: string}
```

- `outputs` is an array of object literals which each contain an `assetID`, `amount` and `to`.
- `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your
  addresses as needed.
- `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the
  addresses controlled by the user.
- You can attach a `memo`, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
- The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to
  hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

**Example Call:**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"wallet.sendMultiple",
    "params" :{
        "outputs": [
            {
                "assetID" : "DJTX",
                "to"      : "X-dijets18jma8ppw3nhx5r4ap8clazz0dps7rv5ukulre5",
                "amount"  : 1000000000
            },
            {
                "assetID" : "26aqSTpZuWDAVtRmo44fjCx4zW6PDEx3zy9Qtp2ts1MuMFn9FB",
                "to"      : "X-dijets18knvhxx8uhc0mwlgrfyzjcm2wrd6e60w37xrjq",

### Events

Listen for transactions on a specified address.

This call is made to the events API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/events`

#### **Golang Example**

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "net"
    "net/http"
    "sync"

    "github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/api"
    "github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego/pubsub"
    "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

func main() {
    dialer := websocket.Dialer{
        NetDial: func(netw, addr string) (net.Conn, error) {
            return net.Dial(netw, addr)
        },
    }

    httpHeader := http.Header{}
    conn, _, err := dialer.Dial("ws://localhost:9650/ext/bc/X/events", httpHeader)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    waitGroup := &sync.WaitGroup{}
    waitGroup.Add(1)

    readMsg := func() {
        defer waitGroup.Done()

        for {
            mt, msg, err := conn.ReadMessage()
            if err != nil {
                log.Println(err)
                return
            }
            switch mt {
            case websocket.TextMessage:
                log.Println(string(msg))
            default:
                log.Println(mt, string(msg))
            }
        }
    }

    go readMsg()

    cmd := &pubsub.Command{NewSet: &pubsub.NewSet{}}
    cmdmsg, err := json.Marshal(cmd)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    err = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, cmdmsg)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    var addresses []string
    addresses = append(addresses, " X-test....")
    cmd = &pubsub.Command{AddAddresses: &pubsub.AddAddresses{JSONAddresses: api.JSONAddresses{Addresses: addresses}}}
    cmdmsg, err = json.Marshal(cmd)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    err = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, cmdmsg)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    waitGroup.Wait()
}
```

**Operations:**

| Command          | Description                  | Example                                                      | Arguments                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NewSet**       | create a new address map set | `{"newSet":{}}`                                                |                                                                                                                                    |
| **NewBloom**     | create a new bloom set.      | `{"newBloom":{"maxElements":"1000","collisionProb":"0.0100"}}` | `maxElements` - number of elements in filter must be &gt; 0 `collisionProb` - allowed collision probability must be &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1 |
| **AddAddresses** | add an address to the set    | `{"addAddresses":{"addresses":\["X-test..."\]}}`               | addresses - list of addresses to match                                                                                             |

Calling **NewSet** or **NewBloom** resets the filter, and must be followed with **AddAddresses**.
**AddAddresses** can be called multiple times.

**Set details:**

- **NewSet** performs absolute address matches, if the address is in the set you will be sent the
  transaction.
- **NewBloom** [Bloom filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) can produce false
  positives, but can allow a greater number of addresses to be filtered. If the addresses is in the
  filter, you will be sent the transaction.
