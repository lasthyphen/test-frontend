  sidebar_label: 'Create an asset',
}

This example creates an asset on the Value Chain and publishes it to the Dijets
platform. The first step in this process is to create an instance of DijetsJS
connected to our Dijets platform endpoint of choice. In this example we're
using the local network `12345`.

```ts
import { Dijets, BN, Buffer } from "dijets"
import {
  AVMAPI,
  KeyChain,
  UTXOSet,
  UnsignedTx,
  Tx,
  InitialStates,
  SECPMintOutput,
  SECPTransferOutput,
} from "dijets/dist/apis/avm"
import {
  PrivateKeyPrefix,
  DefaultLocalGenesisPrivateKey,
} from "dijets/dist/utils"

const ip: string = "localhost"
const port: number = 9650
const protocol: string = "http"
const networkID: number = 12345 // Dijets Mainnet ID is 1, we want to override that default for local network id
const dijets: Dijets = new Dijets(ip, port, protocol, networkID)
```

## Import the Pre-funded Address

Next, lets get an instance of the Value Chain local keychain. The local network `12345`
has a pre-funded address which you can access with the private key
`PrivateKey-ewoqjP7PxY4yr3iLTpLisriqt94hdyDFNgchSxGGztUrTXtNN`. Lastly
get the pre-funded address as a `Buffer` and as a `string`.

```ts
const xchain: AVMAPI = dijets.XChain()
const xKeychain: KeyChain = xchain.keyChain()
const privKey: string = `${PrivateKeyPrefix}${DefaultLocalGenesisPrivateKey}`
xKeychain.importKey(privKey)
const xAddresses: Buffer[] = xchain.keyChain().getAddresses()
const xAddressStrings: string[] = xchain.keyChain().getAddressStrings()
```

## Prepare for the Mint Output

Now we need to create an empty array for the `SECPMintOutput`. We also need a
`threshold` and `locktime` for the outputs which we're going to create. Each
Value Chain transaction can contain a `memo` field of up to 256 bytes of
arbitrary data.

```ts
const outputs: SECPMintOutput[] = []
const threshold: number = 1
const locktime: BN = new BN(0)
const memo: Buffer = Buffer.from(
  "The Value Chain VM utility method buildCreateAssetTx can be used to create a smart digital asset"
)
```

## Describe the New Asset

The first step in creating a new asset using DijetsJS is to provide the specifics of the asset. 
Let's give the asset a name, a ticker symbol, and a denomination.

```ts
const name: string = "MimoToken"
const symbol: string = "MTT"
const denomination: number = 3
```

## Set Up Async / Await

The remaining code will be encapsulated by this `main` function so that the `async` / `await` pattern can be setup and utilised.

```ts
const main = async (): Promise<any> => {}
main()
```

## Fetch the UTXO

Pass the `xAddressStrings` to `xchain.getUTXOs` to fetch the UTXO.

```ts
const avmUTXOResponse: any = await xchain.getUTXOs(xAddressStrings)
const utxoSet: UTXOSet = avmUTXOResponse.utxos
```

## Creating the Initial State

We want to mint an asset with 786 units held by the managed key. This sets up
the state that will result from the Create Asset transaction.

```ts
// Create outputs for the asset's initial state
const amount: BN = new BN(786)
const vcapSecpOutput: SECPTransferOutput = new SECPTransferOutput(
  amount,
  xAddresses,
  locktime,
  threshold
)
const initialStates: InitialStates = new InitialStates()

// Populate the initialStates with the outputs
initialStates.addOutput(vcapSecpOutput)
```

## Create the Mint Output

We also want to create a `SECPMintOutput` so that we can mint more of this asset later.

```ts
const secpMintOutput: SECPMintOutput = new SECPMintOutput(
  xAddresses,
  locktime,
  threshold
)
outputs.push(secpMintOutput)
```

## Creating the Signed Transaction

Now that we know what we want an asset to look like, we create a transaction to
send to the network. There is a Value Chain VM helper function `buildCreateAssetTx()`
which does just that.

```ts
const unsignedTx: UnsignedTx = await xchain.buildCreateAssetTx(
  utxoSet,
  xAddressStrings,
  xAddressStrings,
  initialStates,
  name,
  symbol,
  denomination,
  outputs,
  memo
)
```

## Sign and Issue the Transaction

Now let's sign the transaction and issue it to the Dijets network. If
successful it will return a
CB58 (concatenation of the data bytes and a checksum) serialized
string for the transaction ID.

<Admonition type="info">
 CB58 is a format used to represent keys, addresses, and other binary values in web wallets and APIs.
 CB58 is similar to [Base58Check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) but uses a different checksum algorithm.
</Admonition>

Now that we have a signed transaction ready to send to the network, let’s issue it!

```ts
const tx: Tx = unsignedTx.sign(xKeychain)
const txid: string = await xchain.issueTx(tx)
console.log(`Success! TXID: ${txid}`)
```

## Get the Status of the Transaction

Now that we sent the transaction to the network, it takes a few seconds to
determine if the transaction has gone through. We can get an updated status on
the transaction using the transaction ID through the AVM API.

```ts
// returns one of: "Accepted", "Processing", "Unknown", and "Rejected"
const status: string = await xchain.getTxStatus(id)
```

The statuses can be one of `Accepted`, `Processing`, `Unknown`, and `Rejected`

- "Accepted" indicates that the transaction has been accepted as valid by the network and executed
- "Processing" indicates that the transaction is being voted on.
- "Unknown" indicates that node knows nothing about the transaction, indicating
  the node doesn’t have it
- "Rejected" indicates the node knows about the transaction, but it conflicted with an accepted transaction

## Identifying the Newly Created Asset

The Value Chain uses the transaction ID of the transaction which created the asset
as the unique identifier for the asset. This unique identifier is henceforth
known as the "AssetID" of the asset. When assets are traded around the Value Chain,
they always reference the AssetID that they represent.
